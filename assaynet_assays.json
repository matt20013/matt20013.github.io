The RD2RD2 dosage was chosen based on successful former experiments with related compounds, taking the difference in molecular weight into account [41]. The RD2RD2 amount in the jellies was adjusted based on the weekly determined average body weights of the mice. The cohort of animals contained 42 female mice assigned into three experimental groups consisting of SOD1G93A mice (RD2RD2 n = 14 and placebo n = 14) and a control group of non-transgenic littermates (ntg n = 14). All animals born within one week were stratified into the treatment groups according to gene copy numbers and results of behavioural tests (SHIRPA test and pole test) at baseline. Each mouse was treated for 68 days and the average age at treatment initiation was 53 days \u00b1 2 days.  The anticipated treatment start was based on a previous pilot study in which transgenic SOD1*G93A mice were compared to their wild type littermates from week 4 until week 20 of age. Using the modified pole test, first measurable deficits in motor performance of transgenic mice were detected at an age of 8 weeks [44]. According to the criteria of Ohgomori et al. (2017) [71], the current study was designed to start in the pre-symptomatic phase, before first deficits are visible (7 weeks of age).  In regular intervals, SOD1G93A mice and their non-transgenic littermates were tested in different behavioural set ups (SHIRPA test battery, pole test, grip strength test and splay reflex test of hind limbs) starting before treatment (baseline measurements). The stratified randomisation of the transgenic mice into two equal groups was based on the following criteria: \u2206CT and baseline measurement of the SHIRPA and pole test. All tests were carried out at the same time of the day and all mice were habituated in single cages before starting the particular tests. Mice were observed daily for disease progression. At the end of the study, blood and tissue samples were collected of the SOD1G93A and non-transgenic mice. Blood samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant (plasma) was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Following blood collections, brains and spinal cords of SOD1G93A and non-transgenic mice were harvested and histologically analysed for gliosis (using an integrin \u03b1-M/\u03b2-2 (CD11b) antibody for activated microglia and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for activated astrocytes) and neurodegeneration (using an antibody against neuronal nuclear proteins (NeuN) for mature neurons and a choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) antibody for motor neurons).

A cell viability assay using the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was performed to investigate the cytotoxicity of hSOD1 species that were previously incubated with and without S1VL-21 under aggregating conditions. Therefore, Neuro2a cells were cultivated in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. A total of 2500 cells per well in a volume of 100 \u03bcL were seeded on flat-bottomed 96-well plates (VWR, Radnor, USA) and incubated in a 95% humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C for 6 h. Aggregates of hSOD1 alone and hSOD1 incubated with increasing concentrations of S1VL-21 (1:1; 1:5; 1:10) under aggregating conditions were prepared as described in 0. The samples were collected after 65 h and centrifuged for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C and 100 000g. The supernatant was completely removed, whereas the pellet was dissolved in the same volume of cell culture medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin) and diluted to 1:1.

The Guidelines for ALS preclinical animal research published based on the consensus meeting recommends using 12 or more animals of single-sex for survival analysis. Thus, twelve mice per group and a total of 36 singly housed male mice were analyzed. Purchased mice were randomized into three groups for the analysis. Controls were genotype-, age- and sex-matched mice. The end-stage of a lifespan was recorded when mice are unable to right themselves 30 s after having been pushed on their side based on the guidelines for preclinical studies using ALS mouse models.  Oxaloacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, #O7753) was reconstituted on the day of injection in PBS, adjusted to a final pH of 7.2 \u2013 7.4 with sodium hydroxide, filter sterilized, and injected into the mice as soon as possible. Oxaloacetate was administered by intraperitoneal injection, 2 g/kg body weight, with one injection per day for five days a week. The drug dose, injection method, and frequency are based on the successful outcomes of oxaloacetate administration in wild-type mice in our published study",

Treatment with 100 mg/kg OMT (MB2184, Dalian Meilunbio,China) was performed intraperitoneally daily starting at 55 days of age in both TgSOD1-G93A mice and NTG littermates. The animals in the vehicle (Veh) group received an equal volume of normal saline instead of drug treatments (NTG-Veh n = 9, NTGOMT n = 9, G93A-Veh n = 17, and G93A-OMT n = 16). After 60 days of treatment, some mice were sacrificed for pathological examination. The remaining animals were treated up to the endpoint.

The neurological score scale (0\u20134) was used as suggested by the ALS Therapy Development Institute (Scott et al., 2008; Lincecum et al., 2010). Motor performance was assessed using a rotarod apparatus every three days, starting from 70 days of age. Mice were pretrained for 3 days (16 rpm, 3 trials) before the test. The time that a mouse stayed on the rod rotating at 16 rpm was recorded to evaluate the motor function. Three trials were performed, and the best result of the three trials was recorded with a maximum of 180 s (Knippenberg et al., 2010). Disease onset was reached when gait abnormalities were detected, or two successive instances of weight loss were detected, or when the mice were unable to stay on the rotarod for 180 s. A footprint test (n = 6 in each NTG group and n= 10 in each G93A group) was performed at the ages of 95 days (disease onset in most G93A-Veh mice) and 115 days (advanced stages of the disease) to analyze the motor function. The footprint test indicates muscle strength by measuring the stride length of mice (Filali et al., 2011; Mancuso et al., 2011). The average length of three strides measured from the center of each footprint was recorded as the stride length. The animals that were unable to right themselves within 20 s after being placed on either side or on the back were considered at the end stage and were sacrificed for humane reasons. The behavioral tests, data collection, and analysis were carried out by an investigator who was blinded to the experimental scheme.",

The effects of the CTEP treatment on disease symptoms were analysed in behavioural tests, three times per week starting at Day 80 of life (10 days before starting the treatment), until killing. Sample sizes and animal numbers were predetermined according to the guidelines for the preclinical in vivo evaluation of pharmacological treatments for ALS/MND (Ludolph et al., 2007). We dedicated four newborn litters for behavioural tasks. The experiments were littermate controlled; the mouse was the experimental unit. The pharmacological treatments were randomized within the cage. The same procedure was applied to histology, pharmacokinetics and release experiments. We start a first trial with 15 male + 15 female CTEP-treated (2 mg kg 1 every 48 h) and 15 male + 14 female vehicle-treated mice. Three female vehicle-treated mice were not included in the trial (accidental death before Day 100 of life); thus, we concluded the first trial with n = 30 SOD1G93A mice (15 males and 15 females) treated with CTEP at the dose of 2 mg kg 1 every 48 h and with n = 26 SOD1G93A mice (15 males and 11 females) treated with vehicle.

Experimental mouse model and treatments Transgenic mice carrying mutant human SOD1 with a substitution of glycine to alanine in position 93 (G93A), which show behavioral abnormalities and pathophysiological changes similar to those of ALS patients, have been widely used in ALS research. We purchased the hSOD1G93A mice (B6SJL-Tg-SOD1G93A-1Gur/J) from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The genotypes of hSOD1G93A mice were identified using PCR of tail DNA extracts according to our previous protocol [27]. All experiments and animals care procedures were strictly approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of the Harbin Medical University in China and performed in accordance with the International  Animal Care Guidelines. All mice were kept in a standard light/dark cycle (12/12 h) at room temperature with constant humidity (56 %), and the diet and water were provided ad libitum. DPDS was dissolved in canola oil before administration. In the first section, the hSOD1G93A mice (60 d) were randomly divided into two groups with similar numbers of males and females: (a) hSOD1G93A+ vehicle group (n = 40), treated with canola oil by intraperitoneal injection (10 mL/kg body weight, once daily); and (b) hSOD1G93A+DPDS group (n = 40), treated with DPDS by intraperitoneal injection (50 \u03bcmol/kg body weight, once daily). Age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates were also given the same treatment as control. The dose of DPDS employed in this study was based on a previous study [28]. Sixteen of the hSOD1G93A mice received the treatment intraperitoneally (i.p.) once a day starting from 60 days of age to the day of their death. The WT mice were treated with vehicle or DPDS from 60 to 180 days of age. The body weight of the mice was recorded every 4 days. The rest of hSOD1G93A mice were also treated from 60 days of age and sacrificed at different stages of disease: presymptomatic stage (pre-symp, 75 days), disease onset (95 days), symptomatic (symp, 120 days), late-symptomatic (late-symp, 130 days), and end-stage (ES), for fresh spinal cords or perfusing with paraformaldehyde (PFA) for the histological analysis of spinal cords.In addition, considering therapies are usually applied after patients show symptoms in clinical, some hSOD1G93A mice were administrated with DPDS after disease onset. The hSOD1G93A mice (100 d) were also randomly divided into two groups: (a) hSOD1G93A+ vehicle group (n =25), treated with canola oil by intraperitoneal injection (10 mL/kg body weight, once daily); and (b) hSOD1G93A+DPDS group (n = 25), treated with DPDS by intraperitoneal injection (50 \u03bcmol/kg body weight, once daily). Mice were administered starting 100 days of age and given until the end-stage of the disease.",

Recombinant HDAC1 and HDAC2 enzyme preps were from BPS Biosciences (San Diego, CA). For the determination of dose-dependence curves, test compounds were preincubated with HDAC1 for 15 minutes in an assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, and 0.01% Brij-35. Deacetylation reactions were initiated following the addition of the acetylated peptide substrate. Histone deacetylase assay was performed in standard 384 well plates in a 50 \uf06dl reaction, and the reactions were terminated by adding 5 \uf06dl of 10% formic acid. For the mechanism of action experiments, deacetylation reactions were performed by varying the concentrations of both the substrate and the test compound. The EC50 values of individual compounds were estimated by performing deacetylation reactions with 40 nM enzyme and 1 \uf06dM of the acetylated peptide substrate. To keep the substrate conversion values under 10%, the enzymatic reaction durations for Bio-p53K382Ac and Bio-H4K12Ac were 45 and 60 minutes, respectively.For the MassSpec based detection, assay plates were transferred to a RapidFire200 integrated autosampler/solid-phase extraction (SPE) system (Agilent Technologies, Wakefield, MA) coupled with an API4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Concord, Ontario, Canada). Additional details for the RapidFire Mass Spec analysis are reported elsewhere. The percentage of substrate conversion was calculated as a function of product and substrate mass spectrum peak area. [%Substrate Conversion= 100*[Product/(Product+Substrate)]. Percentage of enzyme activation =100* [(MIN-test compound)/(MIN-MAX)], where MINimal (0%) enzyme activity was detected in the presence of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (10 \uf06dM SAHA) and MAXimal enzyme activity of HDAC1 reaction in the absence of test compound as 100% activity. MAX and MIN values were estimated as an average of 16 wells of a single column of 384-well plate. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 8. EC1.5 was estimated as the concentration of the activator molecule required to achieve 1.5-fold activation22.

Briefly, astrocytes were obtained dissecting cortices of E13-E14 embryos from SOD1G93A mice or their non-transgenic littermates and mechanically dissociation in Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 33 mM glucose. After centrifugation, the pellet was suspended in culture medium (Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/F12, 2 mM L-glutamine, 33 mM glucose, 5 \u00b5g/mL gentamycin, 10% horse serum) and seeded (500,000 cells/mL) onto 48- or 6-well plates coated with 1.5 \u00b5g/mL poly-L-ornithine. Repeated washing with HBSS, 12 h of orbital shaking at 200 rpm and treatment with 10 M AraC once they reached confluence, rendered astrocyte cultures free of microglia, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Spinal cords of E13-E14 embryos were dissected and mechanically dissociated in HBSS, 33 mM glucose. The cells were centrifuged onto a 4% bovine serum albumin cushion at 201 rcf for 10 min and the pellet resuspended in neuron culture medium: Neurobasal (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine, 33 mM glucose, 5 \u00b5g/mL gentamycin, 1 ng/mL brain-derived neurotrophic factor, 25 \u00b5g/mL insulin, 10 \u00b5g/mL putrescine, 30 nM sodium selenite, 2 \u00b5M progesterone, 100 \u00b5g/mL apo-transferrin, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 10 \u00b5M AraC. Cells were seeded (1,000,000 cells/mL) onto 48- or 6-well plates coated with 15 \u00b5g/mL poly-L-ornithine and 2 \u00b5g/mL laminin or onto a pre-established astrocyte confluent layer to obtain spinal neuron-cortical astrocyte co-cultures. Non-transgenic and SOD1G93A co-culture were obtained from non-transgenic and SOD1G93A neurons seeded on non-transgenic and SOD1G93A astrocytes, respectively. Motor neurons obtained from E13\u201314 embryos are fully differentiated and express the specific transcription factors Hb9 and Islet-1/2. A few days after plating, they show adult characteristics such as profuse dendrite and axon outgrowth and synapse formation [21,22]. Co-cultures were treated with HGF/SF, NK1 and K1K1. The molecules were administered at different doses every other day starting from the plating of the neurons, days in vitro (DIV) 0, 2 and 4. Co-cultures were fixed and analyzed at 6 DIV.",

Purified MNs or NPCs were plated onto a Matrigel pre-coated Seahorse 96-well plate at 125,000 neurons per well 24 h prior to the assay. Culture media were changed with 175 \u03bcl of fresh Seahorse DMEM basal medium 45 min prior to the assay. Seahorse analyzer injection ports were filled with 1 \u03bcM oligomycin, 1 \u03bcM carbonyl cyanide-4 (trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), or 0.5 \u03bcM each of rotenone and antimycin A for OCR. Briefly, oligomycin was first added to the cells to inhibit ATP synthase, which affects the electron flow through the ETC, and a decreased in OCR is linked to cellular ATP production. Then, FCCP, an uncoupling agent, is added to the cells where it collapses the proton gradient and disrupting mitochondrial membrane potential. The electron flow through the ETC becomes uninhibited, and OCR will reach its maximum. The FCCP-stimulated OCR can be used to calculate spare respiratory capacity (difference between maximal OCR and basal OCR), a measurement on the ability for the cell to respond to increased energy demand or under stress. The last modulator added to the cell is a mixture of rotenone and antimycin A, which are Complexes I and II inhibitors, respectively. The mixture shuts down mitochondrial respiration completely, and non-mitochondrial respiration can be calculated. Biological triplicates were performed with a minimum of ten technical replicates each. ECAR measures the extracellular acid produced by cells, where lactic acid and pyruvic acid are produced by glycolysis and carbon dioxide is produced during the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Briefly, basal acidification, contributed by pyruvic acid, lactic acid, and carbonic acid, is measured at the start of the assay. Upon addition of 10mM glucose, glycolysis is initiated and the resultant increase in acidification is contributed by pyruvic acid and lactic acid. Next, oligomycin treatment at 1 \u03bcM blocks ATP production from mitochondrial respiration and allows the glycolytic capacity of the MNs to be established. Lastly, 50mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) acts as a glycolysis inhibitor, and its addition allows for the measurement of non-glycolytic acidification. Glycolytic capacity was calculated as the difference between ECAR following the injection of 1 \u03bcm oligomycin, and the basal ECAR reading. Glycolytic reserve was calculated as the difference in ECAR between glucose and oligomycin injections. Biological triplicates were performed with a minimum of ten technical replicates each",

Briefly, to collect the CSF, mice were first anesthetized with buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg). Then, the hair at the back of the head of the mouse from above the eyes, between the ears to the bottom of the neck, was removed using clippers and depilatory cream. The head of the mouse was secured using an adapter. Using a dissecting microscope, scissors, and curved forceps, and by cutting through the skin and the layers of muscle, the base of the skull over the cisterna magna was exposed. The use of a micromanipulator and glass capillary\u2013 attached setup system allowed obtaining a total amount of ~ 10\u201315 \u03bcL of CSF in 10\u201330 min. The technique may cause, although infrequently, some very minor bleeding which can be controlled using cotton buds and Cutoline Alum Hemostatic sticks; the area was cleaned for insertion of the glass capillary with distilled H2O to avoid contamination of the sample. Microscopic analysis was routinely performed to detect blood contamination, and only samples with no blood contamination were used. The CSF samples were stored for further analysis at \u221280 \u00b0C. This whole procedure was performed in conditions of asepsis to avoid any bacterial contamination. In humans, samples of CSF were obtained by standard lumbar puncture. This study was approved by the University of Valencia Institutional Review Board on Human Studies (ref. H1479983999044), and participants provided written informed consent. All the procedures followed the Declaration of Helsinki. Eligible participants were 45 years of age or older and diagnosed with SALS by El Escorial criteria, with an onset of symptomatology for more than 12 months. The study recruited both female and male participants; females were not lactating, had a negative pregnancy test, and agreed to use an effective method of birth control throughout the duration of the study. All patients received riluzole treatment according to standard dosage. The exclusion criteria were identical to those used in a previous study [21]. The simultaneous quantification of different cytokines in the CSF was performed using xMAP technology and a MAGPIX Luminex 200 platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, after the incubation of a specific monoclonal antibody conjugated bead population with 50 \u03bcL of CSF samples for 1 h (room temperature), washed beads (color-coded beads of specific monoclonal antibodies) were incubated with detection antibody solution for 30 min, then with the streptavidin\u2013phycoerythrin-conjugated solution (10 min). After washing, the beads were resuspended in the assay buffer, shaken for 1 min, and then read on the MAGPIX instrument. The results were analyzed with xPONENT 4.2\u00ae software and expressed as picograms per milliliter.",

GCL, GSR, GST, GGT, SOD1, and SOD2 activities were measured as previously described in detail [31]. HMOX2 activity was measured as described by [32]. Protein concentration was determined with the Pierce BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The assay of H2O2 production was based on the H2O2- dependent oxidation of homovanillic acid (4-hydroxy-3- methoxyphenylacetic acid) to a highly fluorescent dimer (2,2\u2032-dihydroxydiphenyl-5,5\u2032-diacetic acid), which is mediated by horseradish peroxidase [31]. For this purpose, cells were cultured in the presence of 100 \u03bcM homovanillic acid and 1 unit/mL horseradish peroxidase. A linear relationship between fluorescence (\u03bbex = 312 nm and \u03bbem = 420 nm) and amount of H2O2 was found in the range of 0.1\u201312 nmol/ 2-mL assay. Generation of O2\u00b7\u2212 was quantitated using an electrochemical biosensor as previously described [33].

In order to ensure accuracy of measured O2\u00b7\u2212 concentrations, the cell culture medium inside the device was mildly stirred during cell released O2\u00b7\u2212 measurement. The electrochemical measurements were carried out on a CHI760 electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments Inc., Austin, TX). Glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) were determined by LC/MS as previously reported [30]. Cell processing was performed according to published methodology, where rapid N-ethylmaleimide derivatization was used to prevent GSH auto-oxidation [34].

Those small percentages were subtracted from the total activity. To ensure that the cell extract does not affect per se the determination of enzyme activities, in samples where the presence of SIRT1 or SIRT3 was previously removed by immunoprecipitation, we proceeded to determine the activity resulting from adding progressively increasing amounts of recombinant murine SIRT1 or SIRT3 (Abcam).

To prepare a soluble cytosolic fraction, isolated MNs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the pellet was suspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (2 \u00d7 106 cells per mL of buffer:20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mg/mL each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A). The cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 2500g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C, the supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. The resulting supernatant was used as the soluble cytosolic fraction (SCF). Protein (50 \u03bcg) was boiled in Laemmli buffer and resolved by 12.0% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to western blotting with specific monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). The anti-SOD1 antibody (ALS mutant) was from Sigma-Aldrich. Blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system; Amersham Systems, GE HealthCare Life Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden). To detect PAR polymers, we used an anti-PAR monoclonal antibody from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The LentiBrite\u2122 LC3-II Enrichment Kit from Merck uses a selective permeabilization procedure that removes cytosolic LC3-I and retains autophagosome-bound LC3-II. We used this procedure which specifically reveals quantities of LC3- II, without interference from LC3-I. Protein bands were quantified using laser densitometry. Equal protein loading on membranes and complete transfer were confirmed by staining the gels and membranes with Coomassie Blue. To make the pooling of data from different immunoblots possible, the relative density of each band was normalized against the internal standard analyzed on each blot.",

These animals carry a transgene containing 6 NF-\u03baB-responsive elements (RE) from the CMV\u03b1 (immediate early) promoter placed upstream of a basal SV40 promoter, and a modified firefly luciferase cDNA (Promega pGL3). The reporter is inducible by LPS and TNF\u03b1 intraperitoneal injection [30]. Animals were randomized divided into four groups and intraperitoneally injected with increasing doses of BANA (10, 20, and 30 mg/kg), benzoic acid (30 mg/kg), dimethyl fumarate (30 mg/kg), or vehicle (DMSO 10% (v/v)/ PEG 20% (v/v) in phosphate buffer). After 2 h, animals wereintraperitoneally injected with LPS (1 mg/kg). Differences in luciferase activity were compared between groups after 3 h following LPS injection. To accomplish that, 150 mg/kg of the substrate D-luciferin (#K9918PE, XenoLight) dissolved in PBS, pH 7.4 was injected intraperitoneally to each mouse. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3.0% induction, 2.5% maintenance), placed in a ventral position in the lighttight imaging chamber, and imaged 10 min after luciferin injection using bioluminescence and X-ray modes (5 s acquisition, performed in Preclinical In-Vivo Xtreme II Optical/Xray imaging system, Bruker, USA).

Cells were treated with BANA (10, 20, and 30 \u03bcM), benzoic acid (30 \u03bcM), or dimethyl fumarate (30 \u03bcM) for 3 h. After treatment, cells were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 30 min. Then, cells were washed and fixed with PFA 4% for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C and washed with PBS. Immunocytochemistry was performed as follows: cells were permeabilized using Triton 0.5% (v/v) in PBS pH = 7.4 for 15 min, and then blocked using BSA 5% (v/v) in PBS pH = 7.4 for 1 h at room temperature. 1:200 rabbit anti- NF-\u03baB-p65 (Abcam, #ab16502) and 1:100 mouse anti-CD11b (BD Bioscience, #BD550219) were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Then, primary antibodies were removed, washed with PBS 3 times for 10 min, and 1:1000 Alexa Fluorconjugated goat anti-rabbit 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A11034) or 1:1000 goat anti-mouse 633 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A21052) antibodies were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After secondary antibodies were removed, cells were covered in glycerol mounting medium with 1:2000 DAPI staining. Cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy using a confocal ZEISS LSM800. NF-\u03baB-p65-positive nuclei were counted and the ratio NF-\u03baB-p65/DAPI was analyzed and compared among groups. Data were analyzed using analyzing tools of ImageJ and GraphPad Prism 7.03 software.",

Cells were treated with BANA (10, 20, and 30 \u03bcM), benzoic acid (30 \u03bcM), or dimethyl fumarate (30 \u03bcM) for 3 h. After treatment, cells were stimulated withLPS (100 ng/mL, 30 min). After harvesting the cells, mRNA extraction using the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN) was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. mRNA yields were measured on Nanodrop device (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cDNA was obtained from 0.5 \u03bcg of RNA, 4 \u03bcL of iScript reverse transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (Bio-Rad, \u2212 20 \u00b0C) in a final volume of 20 \u03bcL filled with nuclease-free water. The Thermocycler was set as follows: priming 5 min at 25 \u00b0C followed by 30 min at 42 \u00b0C for reverse transcription and 5\u2032 at 85 \u00b0C for RT inactivation. RT-qPCR was performed on reverse-transcribed cDNA using SsoAdvanced\u2122 Universal SYBR\u00ae Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) on a CFX96 Touch\u2122 real-time PCR detection system. For each well, 5 \u03bcL of diluted DNA was added to 20 \u03bcL of the mix (containing 1 \u03bcL of each primer, 12.5 \u03bcL of SsoAdvanced\u2122 Universal SYBR\u00ae Green Supermix, 5.5 \u03bcL of nuclease-free water). Each sample was run in duplicate. The cycling parameters were as follows: 30 s at 95 \u00b0C then 40 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 10 and 30 s at 60 \u00b0C. Cq values were obtained for every cycle. Primers were designed on NCBI Primer-BLAST following the best guidelines to exclude genomic DNA amplification. The analysis was done using Bio-Rad CFX manager 3.1 with a threshold set at 650 RFU corresponding to the amplification curves linear portion.

The human muscle cell line was purchased from Promocell (cat#C\u201012530) and was plated (21 000 cells per well) in gelatin\u2010coated 1% (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, Cat#G9382) in water on 48\u2010well plate and grown in a proliferation medium consisting of mix of 62% of MEM medium (Minimum Essential Media, Pan Biotech, Cat#P04\u201008500) and 25% of M199 medium (Pan Biotech, Cat#P04\u201007500) supplemented with glutamine 2 mM (Pan Biotech, Cat#P04\u201080100), human insulin 10 \u00b5g/ml (Pan Biotech, Cat#P07\u201004100), human recombinant epidermal growth factor 10 ng/ml (EGF, Gibco, Cat#PHG0311), human recombinant Fibroblast growth factor basic 2 ng/ml (bFGF, Pan Biotech, Cat#CB\u20101102024), fetal calf serum 10% (FCS, Gibco, Cat#10270106), and 2% of penicillin 10,000 U/ml and streptomycin 10 g/ml (PS, Pan Biotech, Cat#P06\u201007100). The medium was changed every 2 days. Five days after the start of culture, immediately after satellite cell fusion, whole transverse slices of 13\u2010day\u2010old rat Wistar embryos' spinal cords with four dorsal root ganglia (DRG) attached were placed on the muscle monolayer (one explant per well in the central area). DRG were necessary to achieve a good ratio of innervation. Innervated cultures were maintained in a mixed (67% MEM/25% medium 199) medium composed of MEM and medium 199, supplemented with 5% FCS, insulin 5 \u00b5g/ml, 1% glutamine 2 mM, and 2% PS. After 24 hr of coculture, neurites were observed growing out of the spinal cord explants. These neurites made contacts with myotubes and induced the first contractions after ~8 days.  On day 27 after the beginning of the culture, contracting cocultures were preincubated for 1 hr with either ACP (0.14 nM to 40 nM), BCL (32 nM to 2000 nM), or PXT864 (25 combinations) before glutamate intoxication (60 \u03bcM for 20 min), and for a further 48 hr (Figure 1a). To check the contractile functionality of the NMJs and to avoid any confusion with spontaneous contractions, the cocultures were treated with acetyl choline (100 nM). Only cocultures that immediately after application, showed contractions were retained for the study and distributed into the treatment groups. The effects of riluzole on the same endpoints below were investigated. On day 23, cultures were preincubated for 96 hr with or without riluzole (5 \u00b5M) followed by incubation with PXT864 (0.14 nM ACP and 32 nM BCL), riluzole, or both 1 hr prior to glutamate intoxication and for a further 48 hr (Figure 2a).",

The genotypes of the transgenic mice were identified by PCR as in our previous reports [8]. Verapamil (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in ddH2O to a final concentration of 0.125mg/\u03bcL and further diluted with ddH2O before intraperitoneal injection. As there is gender differences in terms of disease progression and lifespan in SOD1G93A mice [24], we used only male mice to avoid gender diversity. To assess the effect of verapamil on disease onset and survival, 24 male SOD1G93A mice were randomly divided into 2 groups: (1) Tg-Vera group, intraperitoneally injected with verapamil at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight/day (n = 12); (2) Tg-Con group, used as control, intraperitoneally injected with the same volume of ddH2O (n = 12). The injection was given once a day starting from 64 days after birth until the day of death. No significant side effects under this dosage were observed in our experiment.  To explore the mechanisms of neuroprotective effects provided by verapamil, 24 SOD1G93A mice and 24 age- and sex-matched wild-type (WT) littermates were randomly divided into four groups: verapamil treatment at the dose of 25mg/kg body weight/day in SOD1G93A mice (Tg-Vera, n = 12) or WT mice (WT-Vera, n = 12), and ddH2O treatment in SOD1G93A mice (Tg-Con, n = 12) or WT mice (WT-Con, n = 12). These mice were sacrificed at the age of 120 days for Western blotting and skeletal muscle analysis, immunofluorescent staining, electron microscopy analysis and calpain activity assay.  All animals were housed at 21 ~ 24? and controlled 12-hour light/dark cycle. Animal use was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and all procedures in our experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of NIH for animal care.",

Briefly, samples were diluted in the calibrator and added to the plate coated with an array of cytokine capture antibodies. Samples were incubated in the plate for 2\u2009hours with shaking at room temperature, followed by washes with the wash buffer provided in the kit. The detection antibody solution was added to each well and the plate was incubated for 2\u2009hours. The plate was washed with the wash buffer and the 2\u00d7 Read Buffer T was added. The signal was immediately measured on a MESO QuickPlex SQ 120 instrument and was analyzed using the DISCOVERY WORKBENCH 4.0 software (Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC., Rockville, MD, USA). Protein concentrations in the supernatants or the plasma samples were measured using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Values in the graphs represent levels of cytokines normalized to the corresponding protein concentrations.",

Cells in each well were transfected with 0.3 \u03bcg Mito-DSred at DIV6-7 using 0.8 \u03bcL Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher Sientific, Waltham, MA 02451) and imaged at DIV8-9. Small molecule libraries were obtained from ICCB-Longwood (https://iccb.med.harvard.edu/). Compounds were pin-transferred into Greiner 384 well plates (cat#784201) at the ICCB-Longwood facility and immediately added to the cells using Agilent Bravo Liquid Handling Platform (Agilent, 5301 Stevens Creek Blvd, Santa Clara, CA 95051). Cells were incubated with compounds at 3\u03bcM for 1 h before and during time-lapse imaging. The plates were dosed and imaged one at a time. Z-scores were calculated for each parameter using the formula Z = (x-\u03bc)/\u03c3. A cutoff of Z-score > 3 in KS integrated distance was used to identify hits. Dose-response curves were performed using either six to eight quarter-log concentration increments with maximum values reaching the concentration used in the screen (3 \u03bcM). Concentrations (in nM) were transformed to log nM and values were internally normalized from low to high as percentage activity. Curve fitting was performed in GraphPad Prism using log(agonist) versus normalized response \u2013 variable slope \u2013curve fitting. Values presented in Figure 2 were collected from an average of three to six well replicates from one 96-well plate.",

Four fields were imaged per well of a 96-well plate containing 30,000 rat hippocampal neurons/well at DIV08-09 using a 20X objective with 2x2 binning. To minimize well to well differences in exposure to compounds, the fields were imaged according to this sequence: field 1 was imaged in every well before returning to the start of the plate and imaging field 2 in every well, and similarly for fields 3 and 4. Imaging one field per well for 96 wells took ~30 min when acquiring 30 frames at 2Hz in each well. As a result, collecting a series from each of the 4 fields took a total of 2 h per 96-well plate. This protocol was used for the primary screen, compound retesting, and dose response curves in Figure 2, as well as for all experiments in Figures 3, \u200b,4,4, and \u200band6A6A\u20136C.

Three different conditions were studied as follows: 1) non-transgenic (NonTg) rats of 160\u2013180 days; 2) transgenic SOD1G93A rats of 195\u2013210 days treated with vehicle (paralysis, 15d-vehicle) and 3) transgenic SOD1G93A rats of 195\u2013210 days treated with 50 or 100 mg/kg/day of BANA during 15 days. After treatment animals were deeply anesthetized and transcardial perfusion was performed with paraformaldehyde 4% (v/v) in PBS pH = 7.4. Fixed spinal cords were removed, post-fixed by immersion overnight in paraformaldehyde 4% (v/v) in PBS pH = 7.4, and then transverse sectioned (30 \u03bcm) in a Leica cryostat.

Human myoblast was grown on 96-well plate in a mix of MEM and M199 medium, supplemented with glutamine 2 mM, insulin, epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, fetal bovine serum 10%, and penicillin/streptomycin. Spinal cord explants with dorsal roots of 13-day-old Wistar rat embryos (Janvier, Le Genest-St-IsIe, France) were dissected and grown on the muscle monolayer. The co-cultures were maintained in a mix medium (MEM/M199), with 5% fetal calf serum, insulin, glutamine, and penicillin streptomycin. Ambroxol treatment was initiated when the spinal cord explants were added to the muscle monolayer and lasted 27 days. The treatment was renewed every other day during medium change. A total of 10 wells per conditions have been initiated. In vitro NMJs and Spinal Cord Explants and Myoblastsnetwork were identified by immunostaining with alpha-bungarotoxin coupled with Alexa 488 and with a primary antibody against neurofilament 200 kD from mouse revealed with an anti-mouse Alexa 568. Sixty pictures have been automatically taken using same acquisition parameter with ImageXpress (Molecular Device) at 10\u00d7 magnification and were analyzed with MetaXpress (Molecular Device). After segmentation of the pictures ( Supplementary Figure 3 ), the total length of the neurite network and the total area of clustered nAChR were measured.",

The embryoid bodies were treated with 1 mM Dorsomorphin (Stemgent) and 10 mM SB431542 (Stemgent) for 4 days, with addition of 1 mM retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mM smoothened agonist (EMD Millipore) after 5 more days. After, embyroid body formation, colonies were then plated on poly-ornithine and laminin-coated plates to differentiate neural progenitors to MNs. After an additional 14-20 days of differentiation, the cultures were dissociated to single cells with Papain (Worthington Biochemical) and DNase I (Worthington Biochemical). MNs were seeded on astrocyte-coated plates at a density of 3-5 3 105 cells per ml in neurobasal containing 1% N2, 2% B27, 20% D-Glucose, 200 mg/ml Ascorbic acid with 20 ng/ml GDNF, 20 ng/ml BDNF and 20 ng/ml CNTF (Ding et al., 2013;Yang et al., 2013).

MN survival was measured by counting Isl-RFP+ cells (H9/Isl-RFP) and Isl+/Tuj1+ cells (hiPSCs). Ara-C was used through the entire experiment. For the thapsigargin and tunicamycin MN survival assays, 1 mM of each compound (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to human MN cultures without astrocytes 3 days after dissociation. MAP4K4 inhibitor was added at the same time as the stressors. Cells were kept in culture for an additional 48 hours and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. MN survival counted as in TF survival assay, number of Isl+/Tuj1+ cells. For astrocyte co-culture, mouse glial cells were dissected from P0-P2 mouse cortices as previously described (Schildge et al.,2013). At least 2 days before MN dissociation, 5,000 glial cells per well were pre-seeded into 96-well plates.

From the age of 63 days, the mice were subjected to a 7-day training session (5 min/day) to adapt to the rotarod test apparatus (4 cm diameter, 20 rpm). Starting from 70 days of age, the rotarod test was performed with three trials (5 min/trial) every day. The behavioral performance was qualitatively recorded to check whether the ALS mice could complete one of all three 5-minute trials. When the animal could not insist for 5 minutes on the apparatus for all three trials, a \u201c\u00d7\u201d (but not the exact duration) will be recorded to characterize the disease onset.

Hemizygous mice expressing a transgene for human SOD1 containing the G93A substitution mutation (SOD1G93A) on the mixed B6/SJL background were from the Jackson Laboratories (strain B6SJL-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1GurJ) and generously provided by Prize4Life. Non-transgenic littermates were used as a control. Prior to treating, mice were allocated based on sex and litter to either the \u201csurvival\u201d cohort or the \u201cbiochemical\u201d cohort. Mice in the survival cohort were kept through to phenotypic end-point to collect data on the effects of treatment on survival and symptom progression, and mice in the biochemical cohort were killed at the age of 120 days to collect tissues for biochemical analyses. Within each cohort individual mice were allocated based on sex and litter to either the sham treatment or the CuII(atsm) treatment group. All treatments were thus spread evenly across sexes, litters and genotypes. Treatment commenced when the mice were 50 days old. Sham treatment involved gavage with standard suspension vehicle (SSV; 0.9% w/v NaCl, 0.5% w/v Na-carboxymethylcellulose, 0.5% v/v benzyl alcohol, 0.4% v/v Tween-80). CuII(atsm) treatment involved gavage using SSV supplemented with CuII(atsm). CuII(atsm) was synthesised as described previously5,45. Dose of CuII(atsm) administered to each animal was 50\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 body weight. Treatments were administered twice daily, 7 days week\u22121 through to phenotypic end-point (survival cohort) or until the mice reached 120 days of age (biochemical cohort).",

Littermates with same gender were randomly assigned to each group which had 12 mice (6 male and 6 female). The strain of the mutant SOD1(G93A) mice is B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1G93A)1Gur/J (Jackson Laboratory). The mice purchased from Jackson were not used immediately. The SOD1(G93A) male from Jackson mated with wild-type C57Bl/6 female, then male offspring were always mated with wild-type C57Bl/6 female mice. The resulting animals are on a background that involves C57BL/6 and SJL and express high levels of human SOD1 gene carrying a glycine to alanine transition at position 93 (G93A). The animal protocol used was approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute. Mice were treated from postnatal day 60 until the endpoints by i.p. injections with either 123C4 or the saline control. 123C4 was dissolved in normal saline at a concentration of 2 mg/mL and sterilized by a 0.2 \u03bcm filter. Mice were treated with 123C4 every day, at a dose of 30 mg/kg of body weight. Animals were assessed daily for the time of onset of hind limb tremor and loss of splay reflex. The endpoint was designated as the point when the mouse could no longer roll over within 10s after being pushed onto its side. At this stage, mice were killed. Disease onset and survival time were compared using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. Difference of survival time from disease onset to end point between 123C4 and saline-treated mice was analyzed with Student's t-test. Values are given as mean \u00b1 SD. Preliminary BBB penetration and PK studies were performed by Agilux (Cambridge, MA).",

A subcutaneously implanted osmotic minpump connected by polyvinylchloride tubing to a stainless steel cannula stereotaxically implanted into the lateral ventricle (Brain Infusion Kit 3; Alzet) was used. Mice received a subcutaneous dose (0.15 mg/kg body weight) of buprenorphine as analgesic immediately before and 12 h after the surgery. During the surgery, they were anesthesized by inhalational of isoflurane 3%. The minipump delivered vehicle or drug, 1 or 10 \u03bcm in the reservoir, for 28 d at a continuous rate of 0.11 \u03bcl/h. After 28 d, the minipump was replaced with another one to infuse the drug for a further 28 d. Pumps were weighed before implantation and at the end of the experiment to check complete delivery of their content. The effect of the MM218 inhibitor on the progression of the disease was assessed twice a week from 13 weeks of age on the basis of Rotarod performance (Pizzasegola et al., 2009). The Rotarod apparatus (Ugo Basile) was accelerated at a constant rate (4.2 rpm/min) from 7 to 28 rpm for a maximum of 5 min. The mice were given up to three attempts and the longest latency to fall was considered in statistical analysis. To observe the treatment effect at a late stage of the disease, paralysis was evaluated, assessed as the age at which the mice scored 0 in the Rotarod test, when the mice were not able to perform the test anymore. The mice were killed when they were unable to right themselves within 10 s after being placed on either side. The time was considered the end stage of the disease and was used to calculate survival. Life expectancy is considered the mean number of days of life remaining after beginning treatment.",

The colony was maintained by crossing B6/SJL males carrying the SOD1 transgene with wild-type B6/SJL females. Animals were housed in a  pathogen-free environment under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with free access to food and water. Genotyping was performed from tail biopsies by a standardized PCR protocol using primers against the human SOD1 gene [11]. Treatment with E2 was carried out only with male animals in two stages of disease: pre-symptomatic (42\u201363 days old) and early symptomatic (77\u201398 days old). Transgenic and wild-type littermates were randomly subdivided into three groups: one wild-type control group (WT), a second group comprising transgenic animals (SOD1), and a third group of transgenic mice receiving E2 supplementation (SOD1 + E2). The SOD1 + E2 group received a hormone pellet (0.011 mg E2, 21-day time-release pellet (0.524 \u03bcg/day), Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) while theWTand SOD1 group was placebo treated. For subcutaneous pellet implantation procedure, a small incision was made in the dorsal neck region and the pellet was placed using a stainless steel trochar (Fig. 1a). The hormone dose was chosen to produce physiological E2 serum concentrations similar to that of sexually mature female mice, ranging from 20 to 200 pg/mL depending on the estrus cycle [37].",

Fifty-, 70-, and 90-day-old female SOD1G93A mice were injected subcutaneously with 5 mg AMD3100 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) or PBS (Biological Industries, Israel) twice a week. Mice received the treatment till the end stage of the disease, which was defined as the point at which animals could not right themselves within 30 s after being placed on their side. At that point, mice were euthanatized with Co2.. Other groups of 50-day-old SOD1G93A mice and wild type littermate (LM) mice as control were also treated with AMD3100 or PBS and sacrificed at 110 days old via i.p anesthesia administration of 100 mg/kg Ketamine (Fort Dodge, USA) and 20 mg/kg Xylazine (Merck, Germany) following trans-cardial perfusion with saline. The spinal cords that were collected from the sacrificed mice served for biochemical (five mice in each group) and histological analysis (three mice in each group). The animals were in house maintained colony. Mice were housed in standard conditions: constant temperature (22 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C), humidity (relative, 40 %), and a 12-h light/dark cycle and were allowed free access to food and water.

Additionally, 12 wild type mice were also divided into two groups and treated with Bxt or vehicle under the regimen previously described.

After a 2-week training period, neuromuscular tests (Rotarod and hanging test) were recorded twice a week beginning at 9 weeks of age until the end of the experiment. A cylinder spinning at a constant speed of 12 rpm was used for the Rotarod test (Mouse Rota-Rod 47600, Ugo Basile, Argentina). On the other hand, a semi-spheric grid of 20 cm in diameter was used for the hanging test. The best of two attempts, which were separated by 10 min rest, was recorded.

Compounds were assayed in 12-point dose-response experiments to determine potency and efficacy. The highest compound concentration tested was 32 \u03bcM, which was decreased by one-half with each subsequent dose. After 24 h incubation with the compounds, MG132 was added at a final concentration of 100 nM. MG132 is a well-characterized proteasome inhibitor, which would be expected to enhance the appearance of protein aggregation by blocking the proteosomal clearance of aggregated proteins. Cell viability was measured 48 h later using the fluorescent viability probe, Calcein-AM (Molecular Probes). Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS, Calcein-AM was added at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcM for 20 min at room temperature, and fluorescence intensity was read in a POLARstar fluorescence plate reader (BMG).

This assay measures the conversion of NAD+ to NADH when GAPDH catalyzes the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to bisphosphoglycerate. A GAPDH standard was used construct a calibration curve for each assay done in 96-well plates. A 10\u03bcl aliquot of sample tissue lysate was added to wells of a 96-well plate in triplicate. The GAPDH reaction mix containing substrates and fluorescent dye for detection are then added and the fluorescence (530 excitation, 590 emission) immediately recorded for 5 minutes in a plate reader with automatic mixing at 30\u00b0C. Reaction rates were calculated from the change in fluorescence from the 1 to 5 minutes time interval. Units of GAPDH activity were calculated from the standard curve.",

        "text": "2.2 Radioligand Binding Studies To verify that JAK4D binds to TRH receptors in human CNS tissue, radioligand binding assays were undertaken. Confirmation that a compound binds to its targeted receptor in native human tissue is critical for progression to clinical development, especially since the apparent pharmacology of recombinant receptors may not reflect that of the native human target (George et al., 2002).[3H][3-Me-His2]TRH (NET 705, 57.4-62.0 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer, UK) was used to label TRH receptors in human hippocampal and pituitary tissue from individual non-identifiable donors aged 45-55 years with no history of neurological disease. These tissues were kindly donated to The University of Miami Brain Endowment Bank. Membranes from these tissues were prepared at the University of Miami and purchased from Tissue Solutions Limited, Scotland. Membranes were prepared essentially as described by (Hirst et al., 2000) except homogenization and resuspension buffers were the same as those we employed previously (Hogan et al., 2008; Kelly et al., 2005, 2002). Membranes were stored at -80 \u00b0C pending assay. Binding assays were conducted essentially as previously described (Hogan et al., 2008; Kelly et al., 2005, 2002). All assays were carried out at 4\u00b0C in 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 177 \u03bcM bacitracin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. In saturation binding experiments approximately 225 \u03bcg of membrane protein were incubated in triplicate with increasing concentrations of [3H][3-Me-His2]TRH (0.6 - 20 nM) for 5 h in a final volume of 100\u03bcl. Non-specific binding (NSB) was determined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM TRH. Competition experiments were conducted under similar conditions by incubating membrane suspensions in either duplicate (pituitary) or triplicate (hippocampus) with 10-12 nM [3H][3-Me- His2]TRH and increasing concentrations of competitor (10-10 to 10-3 M TRH or JAK4D). Competitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 10-2 M and diluted with assay buffer such that the final concentration of DMSO in all samples did not exceed 1%, a concentration at which specific binding of [3H][3-Me-His2]TRH is not affected (Kelly et al., 2002). Bound and free ligand were separated by vacuum filtration using a Brandel CellHarvester and GF/B filters washed with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl solution. The radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting in a TRI-Carb 2100 TR Packard Liquid Scintillation Analyzer. Protein was measured by the method of Bradford.",

        "text": "2.4 Systemic Kainate (KA) Model Neuroprotective effects of JAK4D were initially assessed in a rat model of kainate (KA)-induced neurodegeneration: systemic administration of the excitotoxic glutamate analog KA was used to produce deficits in learning and memory characteristic of human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and the ability of JAK4D to improve functional recovery from KA-induced learning deficits was evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM) test (D\u2019Hooge and De Deyn, 2001; Gobbo and O\u2019Mara, 2005). Male Wistar rats (approximately 250 g) (Comparative Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland) na\u00efve to drug treatment were used. Three independent experiments were undertaken by threedifferent investigators blinded to treatment. Rats were randomly assigned to five different groups. On Day 1 of the experiment, all animals received two i.p. injections. Two groups received saline and three groups received KA (AG Scientific, USA) (12mg/kg i.p. in saline). Two hours later the two saline groups received a second injection of either saline or DMSO:saline (40:60), and the three groups receiving KA were administered either saline, DMSO:saline (40:60) or JAK4D (1mg/kg i.p. in DMSO:saline 40:60). KA-treated rats were observed to develop characteristic KA-induced behaviors, including wet-dog shakes, head bobbing, forelimb clonus, foaming at mouth and seizures, for 2-3 h following KA injection. One animal died within the first 24 h following KA treatment. Following day one, all animals were allowed to recover for 3 days before commencement of MWM testing. During this time, animals were given a daily injection as per their second injection on day one, i.e., either saline, DMSO:saline (40:60) or JAK4D (1mg/kg i.p. in DMSO:saline 40:60). On Day 4, testing was commenced using standard MWM trials as previously described (Gobbo and O\u2019Mara, 2005). Daily injections of treatments as above were continued through the second day of water maze testing. Each animal undertook 5 trials per day, with approximately 20 sec between each trial, for 5 consecutive days. Swim paths, escape latency and swim speed were recorded by an automated tracking system (EthoVision; Noldus, Wageningen, Netherlands). On the day following the last day of escape latency testing, a probe test was carried out to assess reference memory at the end of learning (Vorhees and Williams, 2006). In this test the platform was removed from the pool and rats were placed in the pool and allowed to swim for a 60 sec period. Swim paths were digitally tracked and total time spent in the former zone of the platform was recorded.Statistical analyses of MWM data were performed by an independent biostatistician. Data from the three independent experiments were pooled and analyzed with ANOVA using SPSS with factors representing Day, Group and Day x Group interactions. Since there was no heterogeneity between control groups in which animals received a first injection of saline followed by a second injection of either saline (n=13) or DMSO:saline (40:60) (n=9), these were collapsed for analysis. Likewise, data from the two groups receiving KA followed by saline (n=10) or DMSO:saline (40:60) (n=13) were also collapsed for analysis. A repeated measures design was used, employing the Greenhouse-Geisser three-step approach to significance testing where relevant. In this case, we report the uncorrected degrees of freedom, the corrected p value and the epsilon value of the correction factor. Post hoc tests were calculated to follow up significant effects",

        "text": "2.5 Intrastriatal Microdialysis KA Model The formation of highly reactive oxygen species (hROS), which provides a measure of oxidative stress commonly associated with the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders (Cavalli  et al., 2008; Freinbichler et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2008), can be evoked in a dose-dependent manner by local application of an excitotoxic concentration of KA into rat striatum. hROS can be sensitively quantified as OH-TA, the hydroxylated derivative of sodium terephthalate (TA2-) (Freinbichler et al., 2011, 2008). This method was used to assess the ability of JAK4D to protect against in vivo free radical formation induced by intrastriatal administration of KA (1 mM) during brain microdialysis. Histochemical ex vivo tissue analysis was employed to assess related apoptotic striatal tissue damage.  Male Wistar rats (200-220 g) anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg i.p.) were placed in a stereotaxic frame. A microdialysis guide cannula (concentric design, CMA/Microdialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) was implanted vertically in the right neostriatum (stereotaxic coordinates for neostriatum, relative to Bregma, were AP 0.7, L 3.2, DV 5.5 mm). Appoximately 48 h later, microdialysis experiments were performed on freely-moving rats, always starting at 9:00 am, by inserting the microdialysis probe (4mm exposed surface; CMA/Microdialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) into the guide cannula. The perfusion fluid, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), comprised: 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM Na2HPO4, 0.27 mM NaH2PO4 and 7.2 mM glucose (pH 7.4), plus 1 mM sodium terephthalate (TA2-) used as a chemical trap for highly reactive oxygen species (hROS) (Freinbichler et al., 2011).  After a 60 min stabilization period, the dialysate samples were collected every 20 min. Initially, two fractions were collected to determine basal levels. At 60 min, the two KA-treated groups received an i.p. injection of either vehicle (15% DMSO in saline) or JAK4D (10 mg/kg in vehicle); the control group, not receiving KA, was administered JAK4D i.p. (10 mg/kg in vehicle). The rats were anesthetized (chloral hydrate 400 mg/kg i.p.) just before KA (1 mM) was applied to the neostriatum for 20 min from 100-120 min through the dialysis probe to the two KA-treated groups. Reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of 2-hydroxyterephthalate (OH-TA) in microdialysates was carried out using a Shimadzu instrument (Italia S.r.l., Milan, Italy) with a fluorescence detector (\u03bbex = 315 nm; \u03bbem = 435 nm) (Freinbichler et al., 2011).",

After 6 h, the cell-culture medium was replaced with fresh D-MEM and culture and allowed to proceed for a further 42 h. The cells were then transferred to serum-free D-MEM and immediately treated with SA4503 at a final concentration of 1, 3, or 10 nM. SA4503 was synthesized and gifted by M\u2019s Science Corporation (Kobe, Japan). We also used BD1047 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA; concentration, 3  M), a sigma-1 receptor antagonist, to investigate whether the effect of SA4503 was inhibited by BD1047. Recent studies in the causes of ALS are focused on not only genetic mutation but also abnormalities of neuronal cell metabolism involving glutamate, the role of potential neurotoxins, the deficiency of neurotrophic factors and so on [30]. ALS diseases are caused by various factors. Therefore, in the present study, we used the previous methods using not only SOD1G93A but also serum-free stress as in vitro models of ALS to evaluate the motor neurons toxicity in the pathology of ALS and to simulate the stress condition of genetic mutation and deficiency of neurotrophic factors [24,26]. Cell death was assessed using combination staining with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (PI) performed 27 h after the addition of the SA4503. Images were collected by means of an Olympus IX70 inverted epifluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The total number of cells was counted, and the percentage of PI-positive cells was calculated as a measure of dead cells, as described previously [23]. In a blind manner, at least 200 cells per condition were counted using image-processing software (Image-J ver. 1.33f; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). 2.3.",

To investigate the effect of SA4503 on phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated ERK, and the expression of the sigma-1 receptor, two treatment groups with differing components were prepared: (1) vehicle containing 1% FBS and (2) SA4503 (1, 3, or 10  M). At the end of the culture period, the NSC34 cells were washed with PBS twice to remove dead cells. The NSC34 cells were then lysed using a cell lysis buffer (RIPA buffer: 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1% Igepal CA-630), together with protease inhibitors (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma\u2013Aldrich). The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. The protein concentration was determined from a standard curve of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). A mixture of equal parts of a protein sample and sample buffer with 20% 2-mercaptoethanol (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was subjected to 5\u201320% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Wako). The separated protein was then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF, Immobilon-P; Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA). To visualize the proteins on the membrane, the following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (#4058, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA), rabbit anti-Akt (#9272, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (#4377, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (#9102, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-sigma-1 receptor (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and mouse anti- -actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma\u2013Aldrich). The secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse HARP-conjugated and goat anti-rabbit HARP-conjugated (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The immunoreactive bands were visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate (ImmunoStar\u00ae LD; Wako).

The mice (female mice: vehicle; n = 10, SA4503 1 mg/kg; n = 13) were tested for their ability to maintain their balance on the rod rotating at 5 rpm as described previously [26]. To train the mice to the apparatus, they were allowed to adjust to balancing on the rod as it rotated for 600 seach time for a week from the time they were 5 weeks old. Each experimental session consisted of three trials (10 min/trial; intervals between trials 2 min), and the best performance of the three trials was recorded. We performed these sessions once a week from the time the animals were 5\u20139 weeks and then twice a week until the animals were close to death. Death was taken as an animal\u2019s inability to right itself after 15 s. The date on which the animal died indicated the experimental endpoint, and that date was recorded.",

ATP and other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The assays were performed in a buffer solution using 96-well plates. The compound to be tested (5 mL, 40 mMdissolved in 4% DMSO)was added to each well followed by the enzyme (5 mL, 25 ng/well), ATP (5 mL, final concentration in the well 10 mM) and PDKtidE (5 mL, 4 mg/ well). Then it was allowed to incubate for 60 min at room temperature and ADP-Glo\u2122 reagent (20 mL) was added allowing to incubate again for 40 min at room temperature. Behind the incubation, the kinase detection agent (40 mL)was added and allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the luminescence was recorded using a FLUOstar Optima (BMG Labtechnologies GmbH, Offenburg, Germany) multimode reader. The inhibition activities were calculated based on the maximum activity, measured in the absence of inhibitor. To evaluate the mechanism of CDC7 inhibition of the compounds, ATP-dependent kinetic experiments were performed. CDC7 activity was measured at four different concentrations of ATP (1 100 mM) in the absence or presence of the inhibitors, at two concentrations. The results are presented as double reciprocal Lineweaver Burk plots (1/V vs 1/ [S]).\n",

Mice were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle in a temperature-controlled atmosphere (22 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) with food and water ad libitum. Offspring were genotyped as previously described [44], and male mice randomly divided into four groups (n = 8).

All behavioral test were conducted prior to drug injection to avoid acute effects of the compound administrated. We evaluated motor function in Prp-hTDP-43 (A315T) transgenic and wild-type mice using the rotarod test, a LE8200 device (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain). After a period of acclimation and\ntraining (first session: 0 r.p.m. for 30 s; second and third sessions: 4 r.p.m. for 60 s, with periods of 10 min between sessions) conducted 30 min before, animals were tested with an acceleration from 4 to 40 r.p.m. over a period of 300 s. Mice were tested for three consecutive trials with a rest period of approximately 15 min between trials and the mean of the three trials was calculated. \nTo analyze animals for the hindlimb clasping reflex, mice were lifted on the base of their tail and animals were scored according to the following scale: (i) score = 0 if the hindlimbs are consistently splayed outward, away from the abdomen; (ii) score = 1 if one hindlimb is retracted toward the abdomen; (iii) score = 2 if both hindlimbs are partially retracted toward the abdomen; and (iv) score = 3 if both hindlimbs are entirely retracted and touching the abdomen.

RRL reaction mixture was prepared using Promega's Flexi System (catalogue no. L4540) and consisted of 30% RRL, 10 \u03bcm minus leucine amino acid mix, 10 \u03bcm minus methionine amino acid mix, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium chloride, 4 units of murine RNase inhibitor (New England Biolabs, catalogue no. M0314L), and 0.05% Tween 20. The addition of Tween 20 was necessary to minimize adhesion of the reaction mixture to the multidrop tubing and even dispensing between wells and did not alter the levels of translation from the +1 CGG RAN or AUG-NLuc reporter RNAs (Fig. S1B). 4 \u03bcl of RRL mixture was dispensed per well using Thermo Labsystems multidrop plate dispenser at medium speed. 50 nl of DMSO was then multidropped into columns 1 and 2, and 50 nl of cycloheximide was added to columns 23 and 24, for a final concentration of 3 \u03bcm. To the remaining wells, 50 nl of 3,253 compounds, at 2 mm, from the Pilot LOPAC, Pilot Prestwick, Pilot NCC Focused, and Navigator pathway libraries were pintooled using a Sciclone ALH 300 advanced liquid handling system, for a final concentration of 20 \u03bcm. 1 \u03bcl (3 fmol of +1 CGG RAN, 1 fmol of AUG-NLuc) in vitro transcribed reporter RNA was then multidropped into each well.\n\nPlates were incubated for 30 min at 30 \u00b0C. Translation reactions were then terminated by the addition of 50 nl of 10 \u03bcm cycloheximide to each well, using a multidrop dispenser. 10 \u03bcl of room temperature Glo Lysis Buffer (Promega, catalogue no. E2661) was dispensed into each well with the multidrop, at low speed, which was essential for maintaining the stability of NLuc luminescence. To this, 5 \u03bcl of room temperature NanoGlo Substrate diluted 1:50 in NanoGlo Buffer (Promega, catalogue no. N1120) was dispensed via multidrop at low speed. Plates were then covered, mixed gently, and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Luminescence was measured with a PerkinElmer EnVision plate reader.\n\nThe concentration-response curve and counterscreen were performed using all of the same reagents, materials, and equipment as in the primary screen. The only difference was that selected compounds were added to 384-well plates at eight doses from 50 to 8 \u03bcm, in duplicate, using TTP Labtech Mosquito X1 Hit-Picking Liquid Handler, prior to the addition of RRL.\n\nAfter measuring luminescence, pIC50 values were calculated through the University of Michigan's Center for Chemical Genomics' MScreen software, using a four-parameter logistic equation (43). Initial minimum limits for curve fits were informed by the minimum value of each plate, determined by the cycloheximide-treated internal positive controls. Regression analysis then derived a curve fit, with a calculated minimum and maximum limit, for each compound. IC50 values greater than the maximum dose in the assay (50 \u03bcm) were extrapolated from the curve fit.",

It was synthesized as previously described (Woodruff et al., 2005) and purified by reverse\u2010phase HPLC. For early treatment, PMX205 was administered to mice via their drinking water (20 or 60 \u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121). Based on drinking water measurements taken in hSOD1G93A mice, these dosages equated to 3 and 9 mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121 respectively. Litter\u2010matched female hSOD1G93A transgenic mice were treated with PMX205 or distilled water alone (vehicle) from 35 days postnatal (termed \u2018pre\u2010onset\u2019).

According to the ALS preclinical guidelines (Ludolph et al., 2007; Scott et al., 2008), the matched littermate was also removed from the trial, thus resulting in a final n = 9 for these groups.

        "text": "Neural Stem Cell Proliferation Assay: Neurogenic properties of small molecules are determined based on the proliferation of human embryonic stem cell derived neural stem cells (NSCs), which were derived via a dual smad inhibition. Compound response is measured by the increase in cells based on ATP levels (Promega:CellTiterGlo) after an incubation period of 4 days. NSCs are thawed and expanded over three passages. On the 14th day, NSCs are seeded in Polyornithin/Laminin coated 384-well plates at a cell density of 21,000 cells/cm2 in a media volume of 38 \u03bcL. Four hours after cell seeding, compound solutions are added at a volume of 2 \u03bcL. Stock solutions of the compounds (water, 5% DMSO) are diluted to obtain a dose response (11 points, dilution factor is 2), ranging from 8 \u03bcM to 8 nM. Controls are run to consistently determine the neurogenic properties of the cells. Negative (neutral) control is cell culture media (final DMSO concentration: 0.25%).Positive controls are 1.Cell culture media + 100 ng/mL FGF2 (final DMSO concentration: 0.1%). 2.Cell culture media + 20 ng/mL EGF (final DMSO concentration: 0.1%). 3.Cell culture media + 100 ng/mL Wnt3a (final DMSO concentration: 0.1%). After 4 days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2, the amount of ATP per well is quantified. The ATP concentration is proportional to the cell number. ATP is quantified by using the Promega CellTiterGlo kit. The CellTiterGlo reagents contain a cell lysis buffer, thermostable luciferase (UltraGloTM recombinant luciferase), magnesium, and luciferin. Luciferin reacts with ATP producing oxyluciferin, AMP, and light. The luminescence signal is proportional to the ATP content. The value of negative (neutral) control is determined for each assay plate by taking the average of 16 negative control wells. The neurogenic compound response is calculated for each compound as (compound/negative control) \u00d7 100. The values of EC150 from the dose response curve are determined for each test compound. The EC150 is the compound concentration at which 150% activity of control (100%) is reached. The preferred compounds show a EC150 (\u03bc\u039c) in the range of < 3.0 \u03bc\u039c as shown in Table 1. List of examples, compound name and EC150(uM)",

A 12 h light\u2212dark cycle was maintained, and animals were given free access to food and water.Control and transgenic mice of the same age (\u00b13 days) and from the same \u201cf\u201d generation were selected from multiple litters to form experimental cohorts (n = 20 per group). Standardized criteria for age, weight, and parentage were used for placing individual mice into experimental groups/cohorts. Wild type mice were used for initial toxicity, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics studies. The tolerable dose range and LD50 for 13 was determined in the wild type mice by increasing the dose b.i.d. 1-fold each injection and observed at 75 mg/kg. Drug steady-state level was determined in animals that had been dosed for 1 week prior to sacrifice. The dosing levels of 1.0, 10, and 20mg/kg once a day were administered throughout the levels of the G93A mice.Efficacy was measured using end points that clearly indicate neuroprotective function. These include amelioration of degenerative changes in the spinal cord, improved motor function, and prolonged survival. The mice cohorts were sacrificed at end stage disease using criteria for euthanasia, followed temporally for survival analyses. Mice were observed three times daily (morning, noon, and later afternoon) throughout the experiment. Mice were euthanized when disease progression was sufficiently severe that they were unable to initiate movement and right themselves after gentle prodding for 30 s.Data sets were generated and analyzed for each clinical and neuropathological measure. Effects on behavior and neuropathology were compared in treatment and control groups. Dose-dependent effects were assessed in each treatment group using multiple two-sided ANOVA tests. Multiple comparisons in the same subject groups were dealt with post hoc. Kaplan\u2212Meier analysis was used for survival function. All other statistical analyses were performed using Student\u2019s  test. Data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical comparisons of histological data were made by ANOVA.",

Male transgenic ALS mice of the G93 A H1 high-expressor strain (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were bred with females having a similar background (B6/SJLF1). Offspring were genotyped using a PCR assay on tail DNA. To ensure homogeneity of the cohorts tested, we developed a standardized method by which to select mice. Mice were randomized from 24 litters all within 4 days of age from the same \u2018f\u2019 generation removed from the founding mice in our colony. Bodyweights were taken at 20 days, and mice were equally distributed according to weight within each experimental cohort. Mice under 8 g at 20 days were excluded from the experiments. Only male mice were used in the treatment studies because we have observed gender differences in survival in the G93A transgenic ALS mouse model.9 These experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and were approved by both the Veterans Administration and the University Animal Care Committees. Based upon previous studies,10,11 a dose\u2013response study was performed. Groups (n = 10) of wild-type (WT), untreated G93A, and G93A mice received 1, 10, and 20 mg/kg of 26 injected intraperitoneally once a day in the morning. Mice were observed twice daily, morning and afternoon, for any adverse events. Compound 26 was dissolved in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% DMSO, and fresh solutions were prepared daily. Treatment was started at 42 days, as our studies demonstrate that clinical disease onset begins on or about this age. The ALS mice were euthanized when they were unable to right themselves after being placed on their back for 30 s. Some deaths occurred overnight and were recorded the following morning. Two independent observers who were blinded to the treatment assignment agreed when animals should be euthanized. Survival data were analyzed by means of Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves.",

The staining intensity was first graded as   or \u00fe\u00fe, and any intensity that was neither   nor \u00fe\u00fe was defined as \u00fe. Two authors (FM and KW), who are experienced neuropathologists, rated the immunostained sections from the ALS patients and control subjects in a blinded fashion. The proportions of the PAR-positive neurons relative to the total number of neurons were calculated for each sample.

TW150F borosilicate capillary glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and a programmable horizontal P-97 flaming/brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA) were employed to obtain the patch pipettes. The internal (pipette) solution contained (in mM): 110 KCl, 10 HEPES, 5 K4BAPTA, 5 K2ATP, and 1 MgCl2 (pH 7.2 with KOH). The external (bath) solution included (in mM): 130 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH).

From those, local background was calculated using local minima (75   75 pixel window for SMI-32 and 15  15 for LC3, respectively) interpolation and subtracted from the raw images. Cells were isolated from background-corrected SMI-32 images using uniform smoothing (15   15 pixel window) followed by Otsu thresholding (2-class, variance ratio minimization). Binary masks corresponding to adjacent vesicles were split using Euclidean distance transform followed by watershedding. Holes in the masks were filled using morphologic operations, and the masks touching the image edges were rejected from further analysis. Sizes of those masks were measured in pixels and converted to physical areas each representing a cell. The intensity of LC3was measured and integrated for each cell (SMI-32 image).

Motor neurons were defined according to the following criteria: (1) neurons were located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and were NeuN+ and (2) neurons with a diameter of 20 lm or larger had a distinct nucleolus (Manabe et al., 2003). The numbers of motor neurons in the ventral horn area were calculated using ImageJ software. The data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean(SEM) of cells per section. Quantitative assessment of glial labeling was performed using the relative numbers of glia within a unit of area and the mean integrated density of pixel measurements in the ventral horn as described by Manabe Y et al.

Histological analyseswere performed on cryostat sections of cervicalspinal cord (C2\u2013C6 level), serially cut (30\u03bcmof thickness) and processed as previously described (Bigini et al., 2006). ForNISSL staining, themean number of surviving ventral horn motor neurons (large-sized neurons with area N250 \u03bcm2) for each animal was calculated on at least 30 NISSL-stained sections, interspaced of 90 \u03bcm, to avoid counting the same neurons twice. The analysis was performed by an automatic cell segmentation software (TissueQuest analysis software, TissueGnostics, Vienna, Austria) as previously described (Bigini et al., 2010).Gliosis was evaluated in PRE-084-treated (n = 6) and vehicletreated wr mice (n = 6) on 20 serial slices (1 sample out of five sectioned) belonging to the same spinal region utilized forMNcounting. Immunostaining for bothGFAP and CD11bwas carried out as previouslyreported (Bigini et al., 2008) using a mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody (Immunological Science; dilution 1:5000) and a ratmonoclonal anti-CD11b antibody (Serotec; dilution 1:300). The quantification of glial proliferation was carried out, by the same operator blinded to treatment, by determining the number of GFAP+ and CD11b+ cells in representative areas close to the ventral horns as previously described (Bigini et al., 2008; Park et al., 2003). In addition, since the hypertrophy of glial cells is another important parameter of activation, the relative surface occupied by the staining (expressed as percentage respect to the total squared area) was calculated for both GFAP and CD11b markers. This analysis was carried out by determining a threshold value within a gray-scale (corresponding to the maximum level of an unstained section\u2014background) and considering as positive events all the pixels falling over this value. The automatic counting was carried out by TissueQuest analysis software.",

Immunofluorescence was performed on 30 \u03bcm free-floating coronalsections according to the previously described methods (Peviani et al.,2012). Briefly, sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperaturein Normal Goat Serum (NGS) 10%, Triton X-100 0.1% in PBS 0.1 Mto block unspecific binding sites. For S1R staining, an additionalpermeabilization step was required before incubation with the primaryantibody (incubation with SDS 0.05% in PBS 0.1M for 20 min at roomtemperature) (Hayashi et al., 2011). Then sections were incubatedwith one of the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-S1R (1:500),kindly provided by Dr. Ruoho lab and described in (Mavlyutovet al., 2012); mouse anti-NeuN (1:100, Millipore); mouse anti-SMI31 (1:000, Sternberger monoclonals); mouse anti-KDEL (1:750,Abcam); mouse anti-GFAP (1:2500, Millipore); rat anti-CD11b (1:500,Immunological sciences); rat anti-CD68 (1:100, AbD Serotec); goatanti-CD206 (1:100, R&D); mouse anti-BDNF (1:100, ImmunologicalSciences). For BDNF staining, a biotinilated anti-mouse secondaryantibody (1:200, Perkin Elmer)was used, followed by fluorescent signalcoupling with streptavidine TSA amplification kit (cyanine 5, PerkinElmer) as already described (Peviani et al., 2007). For all the otherstainings, appropriate fluoro-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500dilution) were used: Alexa 549 anti-rat, Alexa 647 anti-rabbit or Alexa488 anti-mouse (Invitrogen). Negative controls without the primaryantibodies were performed.

        "text": "Quantitative evaluation of co-localization between stainings. Co-localization between stainings (e.g. S1R and KDEL)was performedthrough intensity correlation analysis (ICA) by applying an algorithm ofImageJ (public domain software) developed by Li et al. (2004). Thisalgorithm is based on the assumption that if two proteins are partsof the same complex or compartment, then their staining intensitiesshould vary in synchrony (dependent staining). Whereas, if theyare in different compartments, their staining intensity will changeasynchronously (segregated staining). Therefore, when a pixel'sintensity (Ri) is below average in the red channel (i.e. Ri\u2014Rmean b 0);it will be below average also in the green channel (i.e. Gi\u2014Gmean b 0)and viceversa pixels above average in one channel will be above averagealso in the other. If their intensities vary together, the product of thedifferences from the mean (PDM) will be positive. On the contrary, ifthe pixel intensities vary asynchronously, the PDMs will be negative.The algorithm (Li et al., 2004) calculates the intensity correlationquotient (ICQ) where: ICQ = number of positive PDM/total number ofpixels. The ICQ values are distributed between \u22120.5 and +0.5 bysubtracting 0.5 from this ratio. For random staining: ICQ~ 0; segregatedstaining: ICQ iswithin the range of\u22120.5 to 0; dependent staining: ICQ iswithin the range of 0 to +0.5. To analyze S1R and KDEL co-localization,3 cervical spinal cord sections (interspaced of 600\u03bcm) from 6week-oldhealthy controls (CTR, n=3) and wr mice (n=3) were stained withS1R, KDEL and Neurotrace fluorescent NISSL stain, as described above.Images were acquired at 40\u00d7 magnification through a laser scanningconfocal microscope keeping constant acquisition parameters betweengroups. Image layers selected for analysis were converted into 8-bitmonochromatic images. ROIs surrounding the motor neuronal cellbodies were outlined based on Neurotrace stain. Then, fluorescenceintensity for S1R and KDEL channels was quantified in matched ROIsfor each pair of images by using the ICA algorithm (Li et al., 2004). ICQvalues for each cell from CTR and wr sections were considered inthe analysis.",

The mice were then anesthetized with 2%isoflurane in 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 2 L/min and placed in the heated, light-tight imaging chamber. Images of lumbar spinal cord region of interest were collected using high sensitivity charge-coupled device camera with wavelengths ranging from 300 to 600 nm. Exposition time for imaging was 1 min using different fields of view and a F/1 lens aperture. The bioluminescence emission was normalized and displayed in physical units of surface radiance, photons/s/cm2/steradian [31, 32]. The light output was quantified by determining the total number of photons emitted per second using Living Image 4.1 acquisition and imaging software (PerkinElmer,Waltham, MA, USA).

Protein samples were obtained by homogenization ofWA-injected and vehicle-injected SOD1G93A spinal cord (n =3) at P120 in 1\u00d7 cell lysis buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail (#P8340; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) included in the RayBiotech kit. After extraction, samples were spun down at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C and supernatant was used for the experiment. For each group (3 mice/group) samples were  pooled together and incubated with the array membrane overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After washing in the washing buffer (included in the RayBiotech kit), membranes were incubated with biotinconjugated antibodies overnight. Signal detection was performed according to the RayBiotech protocol, by exposing membranes to x-ray film (Biomax MR1; #8701302; Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA), and the obtained results analyzed using ImageJ software [29]. Data are expressed in arbitrary units relative to appropriate positive control. Statistical analysis was performed by using a 2-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t test.",

To improve detection, a ZebraSquare illumination device (ViewPoint, Lyon, France) was used. This consists of an infrared lighting unit that increases contrast between the fish in the tank and the background, especially in totally dark conditions. The images were digitized with an 800\u00d7600 pixels definition. Each pixel is coded on 256 grey levels. The images were processed in real time at 25 frames per second.

Mice were given a neurological score between zero to five as previously described30,31. Zero = no tremor in hindlimbs and full extension of hindlimbs when suspended by its tail. One = tremor in hindlimbs and full extension of hindlimbs when suspended by its tail. Two = tremor in hindlimbs and unable to extend hindlimbs when suspended by its tail. Three = tremor in hindlimbs, unable to extend hindlimbs when suspended by its tail and wobbling gait. Four = tremor in hindlimbs, unable to extend hindlimbs when suspended by its tail difficulty walking with paralysis of one of both hindlimbs. Five = tremor in hindlimbs, unable to extend hindlimbs and unable to get up within 30 s when placed on its side. Onset of disease was defined as the time point when tremor in the hind legs was present as previously described30. Owing to ethical reasons and based on the guidelines in the Animal Facility, mice were terminated if they reached a neurological score of four or latest at day 160. Based on this, survival was defined as a neurological score below 4 at the final day of experimentation. Owing to the fact that mice had to be terminated at day 160, some mice did not reach a neurological score of 4 and, therefore, some of the groups have censored data in the survival analysis.",

Fluorescently labeled hSOD1 (CF633-hSOD1; DOL of 0.5) with a final dimeric concentration of 250 nM was added to samples containing increasing concentrations of unlabeled peptide. Therefore, a 1:1 serial dilution of peptide and a 500 nM CF33-hSOD1 stock solution were prepared in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 6 containing 150 mM sodium chloride and 0.05% Tween-20.

Transgenic SOD1G93A mice expressing mutant human SOD1 with a Gly93Ala substitution (B6SJL-Tg-SOD1G93A-1Gur) were originally obtained from Jackson Laboratories (No. 002726). The genotypes of the transgenic mice were identified by PCR as in our previous reports [8]. Verapamil (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in ddH2O to a final concentration of 0.125mg/\u03bcL and further diluted with ddH2O before intraperitoneal injection. As there is gender differences in terms of disease progression and lifespan in SOD1G93A mice [24], we used only male mice to avoid gender diversity. To assess the effect of verapamil on disease onset and survival, 24 male SOD1G93A mice were randomly divided into 2 groups: (1) Tg-Vera group, intraperitoneally injected with verapamil at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight/day (n = 12); (2) Tg-Con group, used as control, intraperitoneally injected with the same volume of ddH2O (n = 12). The injection was given once a day starting from 64 days after birth until the day of death. No significant side effects under this dosage were observed in our experiment. To explore the mechanisms of neuroprotective effects provided by verapamil, 24 SOD1G93A mice and 24 age- and sex-matched wild-type (WT) littermates were randomly divided into four groups: verapamil treatment at the dose of 25mg/kg body weight/day in SOD1G93A mice (Tg-Vera, n = 12) or WT mice (WT-Vera, n = 12), and ddH2O treatment in SOD1G93A mice (Tg-Con, n = 12) or WT mice (WT-Con, n = 12). These mice were sacrificed at the age of 120 days for Western blotting and skeletal muscle analysis, immunofluorescent staining, electron microscopy analysis and calpain activity assay. All animals were housed at 21 ~ 24\u2103 and controlled 12-hour light/dark cycle.

In order to assess mice general condition, starting at 6 weeks of age, we adopted a behavioral score system based on a scale from 1 to 5 as follows: 5= healthy without any symptom of paralysis; 4=slight signs of destabilized gait and paralysis of the hind limbs; 3=obvious paralysis and destabilized gait; 2=fully developed paralysis of the hind limbs, animals only crawl on the forelimbs; and 1= fully developed paralysis of the hind limbs, animals predominantly lie on the side, and/or are not able to straighten up within 30 s, after turning them on the back [21].After reaching a score of 1, the animals were euthanized, according to the guidelines for preclinical testing and colony management [23]. Rotarod performance was tested two times a week on a rotarod apparatus (Ugo Basile 7650 model) at a constant speed of 15 rpm over a maximum of 180-s period, starting at 8 weeks of age until animals were unable to remain on the rotarod. After a training period of 3 days, the latency to fall off was recorded as a measure of the competence to motor function. During each day test, the animals had three trials and the best performance was recorded and included in the data analysis [24].",

Mice were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (500 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde at pH 7.4. Tissue samples were then postfixed overnight in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS and then cryoprotected in 30 % sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C. Tissues were then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Spinal cords (L3-L5) were cut at 30 \u03bcm of thickness with a frozen microtome. The double immunofluorescence analysis was performed according to the following procedure. A rectangle was drawn around the sections with a PAP pen (Sigma-Aldrich). After 1 to 2 h of air-drying, sections were blocked in PBS containing 10%normal donkey serum and 0.3 % Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Spinal cord sections were incubated with either mouse glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP (1:10, AbD Serotech, Oxford, UK), rabbit polyclonal anti-Iba1 (1:200, Wako, Richmond, VA), monoclonal rat anti-CD68 (1:100, AbD Serotech), or mouse monoclonal anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN) (1:200, Millipore,MA, USA) in PBS supplemented with 0.3%Triton X-100 and 2 % normal donkey serum, for 24 h at 4 \u00b0C. Slides were washed with PBS and incubated with appropriate fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies for 3 h at room temperature. The secondary antibodies used were Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch, PA, USA; red immunofluorescence), Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:100, Alexa, Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR, USA; green immunofluorescence), or Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch; red immunofluorescence). PBS washes (3\u00d75 min) were performed, and slides were coverslipped with Fluoromount medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Immunofluorescence was analyzed by means of a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, LSM700, Germany) equipped with four laser lines: 405, 488, 561, and 639 nm and using always identical acquisition parameters (laser intensity, photomultiplier gain, pinhole aperture, electronic zoom) for all the images. The brightness and contrast of the digital images were adjusted using the Zen software. Quantification of GFAP, Iba1, and CD68 immunoreactivities was performed on lumbar spinal cord sections (an average of six sections for each animal in each group were analyzed), using the ImageJ software (version 1.47, National Institutes of Health, USA), after background subtraction. Data are expressed as arbitrary units with respect to wild-type mice. SOD1G93A primary microglia were fixed for 20 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde, permeabilized for 5 min in PBS containing 0.1 % Triton X-100. The cells were then incubated for 1.5 h at 37 \u00b0C with rabbit Iba1 (1:200,Wako) in 1%BSA in PBS.

Animals used in these experiments were not enrolled in behavioural tasks. Tissue extracts were prepared by homogenization in ice of the brain or liver in 0.9% NaCl (20% p/v). Samples were added of an equal volume of acetonitrile, vortexed and incubated at 22 C for 60 min. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 7000  g for 10 min, and supernatants were collected. In the case of plasma, obtained by anticoagulation of blood samples with EDTA, 100-\u03bcl sample was added with 100-\u03bcl acetonitrile and then processed as above. CTEP serial dilutions in DMSO and acetonitrile, and tissue brain, liver and plasma from untreated mice were used for calibration curves. CTEP content was determined by HPLC using a Vanquish (Thermo Fisher Scientific) UHPLC system composed of binary pump, auto-sampler and column oven. Samples (5 \u03bcl) were injected onto a Symmetry 300\u2122 C18 column (150   1 mm, 3.5-\u03bcm particle size) maintained at 40 C (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA; http://www. waters.com). The eluents were 0.1% formic acid in water (Eluent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (Eluent B). Flow rate was 100 \u03bcl min 1, and the elution was 5-min isocratic 20% B, 15-min linear gradient to 60% B, 3-min linear gradient to 100% B, 12-min isocratic 100% B and 1-min linear gradient to 20% B. The reequilibration time in 20% B was 14 min. After HPLC separation, the eluent was analysed by Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, USA) equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source (HESI-II). Before each acquisition series, the mass spectrometer was calibrated with the positive ion calibration solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were analysed by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mode under positive polarity condition. Instrument and collision cell (HCD) parameters were optimized by syringe direct infusion of CTEP in acetonitrile. Sheath and auxiliary gas flow rate were 33 and 10, respectively; spray voltage was 4.0 kV; capillary temperature was 250 C; S-lens RF level was 100; and auxiliary gas heater temperature was 180 C. Software used for operating the UHPLC/HR-MS was Xcalibur (Version 4.1; RRID:SCR_014593). The PRM mode analysis was conducted at 17,500 resolution. The autogain control (AGC) was optimized at 2 x 105 with a maximum injection time (maxIT) of 250 ms, and the normalized collision energy (NCE) for fragmentation of CTEP was optimized at 95. Quantitation of CTEP in PRM mode was based on fragmentation of precursor ion 392 m/z (CTEP) to 128.05 m/z production. CTEP final concentration was then expressed as \u03bcg g 1 brain tissue or \u03bcg ml 1 plasma.",

All animals had one habituation session to the CatWalk apparatus one day before the first test. Each animal was tested every or every second day until the onset of clinical signs. On the testing day, each animal was allowed to explore and walk freely through the apparatus detection \u201crunway\u201d without any rewards. During this test period of maximum 10 minutes, at least 3 videos of an uninterrupted crossing of the recording field of the runway (approximately 35 cm) were automatically recorded. Runs for analysis were selected based on a minimum of four step cycles in the crossing field, such that each step cycle involved capturing the use of each of the four paws irrespective of the order in which paws were used. After classification of the footprints in these runs using the CatWalk software, qualified data39\u201341 w ere e xported f or further analysis to the RStudio.42 Given that the disease progression has individual characteristics resulting in a floating date of the manifestation of clinical signs, we have compared changes in the gait of animals in the reverse direction starting from the day when first clinical signs were observed to the day of the beginning of data collection. In order to combine the data of gait analysis between the animals with different ages, time intervals were adjusted to 25 days for each animal starting from the day of the manifestation of clinical signs, as illustrated in Figure S1. Statistical analysis was done using nonparametric Wilcoxon test for each of CatWalk parameters of untreated and DF402-treated mice. The difference was considered significant if it was determined in at least one of the time intervals: 1\u201310 days, 11\u201318 days, and 19\u201325 days with p < 0.05 (Benjamini-Hochberg correction). Representative analysis of significantly changed group of variables was performed by calculating the frequency of components implemented in the intrinsic structure of CatWalk parameters.

Cohorts of tg mice expressing mutated G37R-hSOD1 were bred and identified by genotyping of tail DNA as described (Martin et al., 2007, 2009; Wong and Martin, 2010). All mice were housed in the institutional vivarium with generally 4\u20135 mice per cage and ad libitum food and water. Starting at 6 months of age, before the onset of overt symptoms, male G37R-hSOD1 mice were treated with 300 \u00b5g (100 \u00b5l) of GNX-4728 or vehicle (DMSO/cyclodextrin/saline) every other day by intraperitoneal injection. Only male mice were used because of known gender-differences in the involvement of the mPTP regulator cyclophilin D in ALS pathobiology (Martin et al., 2009) and to minimize burden to the operators treating mice over long-term with individual injections. This dosage and treatment regimen was in part based on preliminary data showing GNX-4728 protection of ALS mouse spinal cord mitochondria from Ca2+-induced swelling (Martin et al., unpublished observations). The treatment group size totals were 18\u201320 mice, but these mice were divided among different experiments, including survival studies. The initial randomization was accomplished using the envelope method with knowledge of litter origin so that individuals from the same litter could be distributed across groups. Mice were maintained in the colony and received vehicle or GNX-4728 treatment. For survival experiments, the vehicle and GNX-4728 group sizes were 10 and 12, respectively. The mice were observed once a day. The disease progresses usually from hindleg paraplegia with some function of the forelimbs remaining. When animals developed paraplegia, ad libitum nutrigel and chow were placed in the cage, and water was available at a bottom-cage level drinking spout. At this time locomotor activity is compromised but the animals can still ambulate to access food and water. At this stage, the mice are observed three or more times a day. Endstage disease was defined as complete lack of locomotor activity, detected within 2\u20134 h after onset, at which time the mice were euthanized. A subgroup of mice was killed before endstage to assess the efficacy of GNX-4728 using histological endpoints. Disease onset was assessed by running wheel activity and hind-limb paresis. Vehicle and GNX-4728 treated mice and age-matched non-tg littermate mice were evaluated for neurologic deficit. They were assessed at 12 months of age using a voluntary activity wheel (Harvard Apparatus).",

Vehicle and GNX-4728 treated tg mice and na\u00efve mice (n = 5 per group) at 12 months of age were deeply anesthetized and perfused by cardiac puncture with ice-cold 100 mM phosphate-buffered normal saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After perfusion-fixation, mouse bodies were stored at 4\u00b0C overnight and then the spinal cord and diaphragm were removed from each mouse. Spinal cords were cryoprotected (20% glycerol) before they were frozen-sectioned (40 \u00b5m) transversely using a sliding microtome. Serial tissue section arrays were stored individually in 96-well plates in anti-freeze buffer. The diaphragm was removed as a complete tissue sheet (Comerford and Fitzgerald, 1986) and placed in PBS at 4\u00b0C until processed for NMJ visualization.Nissl-stained transverse sections of spinal cord were used to count the number of motor neurons in vehicle and GNX-4728 treated tg mice and in age-matched littermate non-tg mice. Spinal cord sections were selected with a random start and then systematically sampled (every 10th section) to generate a subsample of sections from each mouse lumbar spinal cord that was mounted on glass slides and stained with cresyl violet for cell counting. Nissl-stained motor neurons in ventral horn were counted by individuals blinded to experimental treatment, using strict morphological criteria, in digital images acquired with a Nikon microscope at 200x magnification. These criteria included a round, open, pale nucleus (not condensed and darkly stained), globular Nissl staining of the cytoplasm, and a diameter of ~20\u201340 \u00b5m. With these criteria, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia were excluded from the counts, but these counts are likely to estimate the combined populations of \u03b1- and \u03b3-motor neurons.Mitochondrial pathology was assessed specifically within spinal cord motor neurons using immunohistochemistry. Free-floating spinal cord sections from GNX-4728- and vehicle-treated G37R-hSOD1 tg mice and age-matched non-tg mice were stained by an immunoperoxidase method with antibodies to the mitochondrial matrix marker superoxide dismutase-2 (Stressgen) and diaminobenzidine as described (Martin et al., 2007). Mitochondrial diameters within motor neurons were measured by individuals blinded to experimental history using ocular filar micrometry as described (Martin et al., 2007).Diaphragm motor endplates were visualized with Alexa 594-conjugated \u03b1-bungarotoxin (BTX, Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) as described (Martin and Liu, 2007). Dual labeling was done to visualize motor neuron distal axons and their terminals in whole diaphragm preparations by immunofluorescent detection of neurofilament protein using a monoclonal antibody (SMI-32, Convance) and confocal microscopy as described (Martin and Liu, 2007). The immunofluorescent labeling for neurofilament was used to determine whether the BTX-labeled motor endplates were innervated. Confocal microscope images of the typical band distributions of motor endplates in diaphragm (Comerford and Fitzgerald, 1986) were scored as innervated (normal) if there was overlap with the axon terminal or denervated (unoccupied) if the endplate was not associated with an axon. NMJ imaging and scoring were performed by individuals unaware of mouse treatment.",

Additionally, 12 wild type mice were also divided into two groups and treated with Bxt or vehicle under the regimen previously described.

The lumbosacral enlargement of the spinal cord (L2-S1) was dissected and post-fixed for 2 h. Spinal cord fragments were either dehydrated and embedded in diethylene glycol or processed for mechanical dissociation of MNs as previously reported (Pena et al., 2001). For neuronal dissociation, small tissue fragments from the anterior horn were transferred to a drop of PBS on a siliconized slide. Then, a coverslip was applied on top of the slide and the tissue was squashed by percussion with a histologic needle in order to dissociate neuronal cell bodies. The preparation was then frozen in dry ice, and the coverslip removed using a razor blade. Using this procedure, most MNs remained adhered to the slide. Cell samples were processed in 96% ethanol at 4\u00b0C for 10 min, which increases the adhesion of cells to the slide, and rehydrated progressively in 70% ethanol and PBS. These squash preparations were used for propidium iodide (PI), a fluorescent staining of nucleic acids, and immunofluorescence.

The early loss of MN was evaluated at day 75 and 95 of life. The number of MNs was counted in four sections of each animal at segment L4 using hematoxylin\u2013eosin staining. Only polygonal-shaped neurons present in ventral horns, larger than 20 \u03bcm and with prominent nucleoli, were used for the quantitative analysis as previously reported (Mancuso et al., 2014). For immunofluorescence, tissue sections and squash preparations were sequentially treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, 0.1M glycine in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. Then, the sections were incubated with the specific secondary antibody conjugated with FITC or Cy3 and mounted with Vectashield (Vector, USA). Confocal images were obtained with a LSM510 (Zeiss, Germany) laser scanning microscope using 40\u00d7 oil or 63\u00d7 oil (1.4 NA) objectives. In order to avoid overlapping signals, images were obtained by sequential excitation at 488 and 543 nm, to detect FITC and Cy3, respectively. Images were processed using Photoshop software. To quantify astrogliosis, confocal images of the ventral horn\u2019s gray matter immunostained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were recorded by using a 40\u00d7 oil objective and the same confocal settings. Images were background corrected by reference regions outside the tissue and fluorescence intensities were estimated by using the ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The relative nuclear levels of RXR\u03b1 in MNs of wild type, Bxt-treated and vehicle-treated transgenic SOD1G93A mice were determined on 5 \u03bcm thick cryostat sections immunostained with the anti-RXR\u03b1 antibody. Only anterior horn neurons larger than 20 \u03bcm and with prominent nucleoli were sampled. We used three animals per experimental group and at least 35 neurons per animal were sampled. Confocal images were recorded by using a 63\u00d7 oil objective (NA 1.4) and the same confocal settings at a resolution of 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixels.

For each biochemical assay (rtqPCR or WB) at least three mice of each animal group were used. Age-matched wild type mice receiving vehicle were used for comparison. After being anesthetized, they were decapitated and the lumbar spinal cord quickly removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Gene expression was assessed by rtqPCR. RNA from spinal cord samples was isolated with Trizol following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad) and purified with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as previously reported (Delgado- Calle et al., 2011). Aliquots of RNA were reverse-transcribed with the PrimeScrip RT kit (Takara) using random hexamers as primers. Then, the expression of cathepsin D was determined rtqPCR using gene-specific primers and TaqMan probes (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA). The threshold cycle (Ct) for each well was determined. The results were normalized to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1). Relative gene expression was calculated as 2\u2212\u039bCT, where \u039bCT is the difference between the gene of interest threshold cycle and the HPRT1 threshold cycle. For WB analysis, the spinal cord samples (the ventral region of lumbosacral enlargement) were homogenized in a lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 \u03bcg/ ml aprotinin) and the homogenates were centrifuged. The protein in the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and afterwards transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, stained with antibodies, and visualized with the Odyssey system (LI-COR Biotechnology). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and tubulin were used as protein loading controls. The antibodies used were a goat polyclonal anti-cathepsin D (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Europe) and mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). ImageJ software (U. S.

The left-brain hemisphere and the lumbar spinal cord (L1-L5 tract) were cut for immunohistological analysis using a cryotome (Leica Biosystems Nussloch GmbH,Wetzlar, Germany). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 20  m sagittal frozen brain sections and on 12  m transverse lumbar spinal cord sections (L1-L5 tract). The brain and lumbar region of the spinal cord were identified as described previously [77\u201379]. To avoid differences in staining intensity, which might affect measurements, every staining session was performed in one batch. Gliosis of astrocytes and microglia (antibodies GFAP and CD11b) was assessed in SOD1G93A mice and their non-transgenic littermates. Furthermore, OD1G93A mice were investigated for mature neurons (antibody NeuN) and motor neurons (antibody ChAT) in the brain. Tissue sections were thawed and fixed with 4  C pre-cooled 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and followed by an antigen retrieval with 70% formicacid for 10 min. The sections were rinsed, and elimination of endogenous peroxidases was  ensured by incubation in 3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min. After a further washing step, sections were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4  C in a humid chamber (GFAP: DAKO Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA; NeuN: Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany; ChAT: Novus Biologicals Europe, Abingdon, United Kingdom) or for two hours at room temperature (CD11b: Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in tris buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100 (TBST) with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (GFAP and NeuN), 1:2000 in tris buffered saline (TBS) with 1% BSA (CD11b) or 1:1000 in phosphate bufferedsaline with 0.25% Triton X-100 (PBST) with 1% BSA (ChAT). Afterward, sections of SOD1G93A mice were rinsed and incubated with biotinylated secondary anti-mouse, anti-rabbit or anti-donkey antibody (1:1000 in TBST with 1% BSA (NeuN and GFAP), 1:1000 in TBS with 1% BSA (CD11b) or in PBST with 1% BSA (ChAT), Sigma Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) for two hours at room temperature followed by 3,30-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) enhanced with saturated nickel ammonium sulfate solution.

        "text": "2.2 Radioligand Binding Studies. To verify that JAK4D binds to TRH receptors in human CNS tissue, radioligand binding assays were undertaken. Confirmation that a compound binds to its targeted receptor in native human tissue is critical for progression to clinical development, especially since the apparent pharmacology of recombinant receptors may not reflect that of the native human target (George et al., 2002).[3H][3-Me-His2]TRH (NET 705, 57.4-62.0 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer, UK) was used to label TRH receptors in human hippocampal and pituitary tissue from individual non-identifiable donors aged 45-55 years with no history of neurological disease. These tissues were kindly donated to The University of Miami Brain Endowment Bank. Membranes from these tissues were prepared at the University of Miami and purchased from Tissue Solutions Limited, Scotland. Membranes were prepared essentially as described by (Hirst et al., 2000) except homogenization and resuspension buffers were the same as those we employed previously (Hogan et al., 2008; Kelly et al., 2005, 2002). Membranes were stored at -80 \u00b0C pending assay. Binding assays were conducted essentially as previously described (Hogan et al., 2008; Kelly et al., 2005, 2002). All assays were carried out at 4\u00b0C in 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 177 \u03bcM bacitracin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. In saturation binding experiments approximately 225 \u03bcg of membrane protein were incubated in triplicate with increasing concentrations of [3H][3-Me-His2]TRH (0.6 - 20 nM) for 5 h in a final volume of 100\u03bcl. Non-specific binding (NSB) was determined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM TRH. Competition experiments were conducted under similar conditions by incubating membrane suspensions in either duplicate (pituitary) or triplicate (hippocampus) with 10-12 nM [3H][3-Me- His2]TRH and increasing concentrations of competitor (10-10 to 10-3 M TRH or JAK4D). Competitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 10-2 M and diluted with assay buffer such that the final concentration of DMSO in all samples did not exceed 1%, a concentration at which specific binding of [3H][3-Me-His2]TRH is not affected (Kelly et al., 2002). Bound and free ligand were separated by vacuum filtration using a Brandel Cell Harvester and GF/B filters washed with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl solution. The radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting in a TRI-Carb 2100 TR Packard Liquid Scintillation Analyzer. Protein was measured by the method of Bradford.",

        "text": "2.4 Systemic K ainate (KA) Model.Neuroprotective effects of JAK4D were initially assessed in a rat model of kainate (KA)-induced neurodegeneration: systemic administration of the excitotoxic glutamate analog KA was used to produce deficits in learning and memory characteristic of human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and the ability of JAK4D to improve functional recovery from KA-induced learning deficits was evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM) test (D\u2019Hooge and De Deyn, 2001; Gobbo and O\u2019Mara, 2005). Male Wistar rats (approximately 250 g) (Comparative Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland) na\u00efve to drug treatment were used. Three independent experiments were undertaken by threedifferent investigators blinded to treatment. Rats were randomly assigned to five different groups. On Day 1 of the experiment, all animals received two i.p. injections. Two groups received saline and three groups received KA (AG Scientific, USA) (12mg/kg i.p. in saline). Two hours later the two saline groups received a second injection of either saline or DMSO:saline (40:60), and the three groups receiving KA were administered either saline, DMSO:saline (40:60) or JAK4D (1mg/kg i.p. in DMSO:saline 40:60). KA-treated rats were observed to develop characteristic KA-induced behaviors, including wet-dog shakes, head bobbing, forelimb clonus, foaming at mouth and seizures, for 2-3 h following KA injection. One animal died within the first 24 h following KA treatment. Following day one, all animals were allowed to recover for 3 days before commencement of MWM testing. During this time, animals were given a daily injection as per their second injection on day one, i.e., either saline, DMSO:saline (40:60) or JAK4D (1mg/kg i.p. in DMSO:saline 40:60). On Day 4, testing was commenced using standard MWM trials as previously described (Gobbo and O\u2019Mara, 2005). Daily injections of treatments as above were continued through the second day of water maze testing. Each animal undertook 5 trials per day, with approximately 20 sec between each trial, for 5 consecutive days. Swim paths, escape latency and swim speed were recorded by an automated tracking system (EthoVision; Noldus, Wageningen, Netherlands). On the day following the last day of escape latency testing, a probe test was carried out to assess reference memory at the end of learning (Vorhees and Williams, 2006). In this test the platform was removed from the pool and rats were placed in the pool and allowed to swim for a 60 sec period. Swim paths were digitally tracked and total time spent in the former zone of the platform was recorded Statistical analyses of MWM data were performed by an independent biostatistician. Data from the three independent experiments were pooled and analyzed with ANOVA using SPSS with factors representing Day, Group and Day x Group interactions. Since there was no heterogeneity between control groups in which animals received a first injection of saline followed by a second injection of either saline (n=13) or DMSO:saline (40:60) (n=9), these were collapsed for analysis. Likewise, data from the two groups receiving KA followed by saline (n=10) or DMSO:saline (40:60) (n=13) were also collapsed for analysis. A repeated measures design was used, employing the Greenhouse-Geisser three-step approach to significance testing where relevant. In this case, we report the uncorrected degrees of freedom, the corrected p value and the epsilon value of the correction factor. Post hoc tests were calculated to follow up significant effects.",

The formation of highly reactive oxygen species (hROS), which provides a measure of oxidative stress commonly associated with the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders (Cavalli et al., 2008; Freinbichler et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2008), can be evoked in a dose-dependent manner by local application of an excitotoxic concentration of KA into rat striatum. hROS can be sensitively quantified as OH-TA, the hydroxylated derivative of sodium terephthalate (TA2-) (Freinbichler et al., 2011, 2008). This method was used to assess the ability of JAK4D to protect against in vivo free radical formation induced by intrastriatal administration of KA (1 mM)Male Wistar rats (200-220 g) anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg i.p.) were placed in a stereotaxic frame. A microdialysis guide cannula (concentric design, CMA/Microdialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) was implanted vertically in the right neostriatum (stereotaxic coordinates for neostriatum, relative to Bregma, were AP 0.7, L 3.2, DV 5.5 mm). Appoximately 48 h later, microdialysis experiments were performed on freely-moving rats, always starting at 9:00 am, by inserting the microdialysis probe (4mm exposed surface; CMA/Microdialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) into the guide cannula. The perfusion fluid, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), comprised: 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM Na2HPO4, 0.27 mM NaH2PO4 and 7.2 mM glucose (pH 7.4), plus 1 mM sodium terephthalate (TA2-) used as a chemical trap for highly reactive oxygen species (hROS) (Freinbichler et al., 2011). After a 60 min stabilization period, the dialysate samples were collected every 20 min. Initially, two fractions were collected to determine basal levels. At 60 min, the two KA-treated groups received an i.p. injection of either vehicle (15% DMSO in saline) or JAK4D (10 mg/kg in vehicle); the control group, not receiving KA, was administered JAK4D i.p. (10 mg/kg in vehicle). The rats were anesthetized (chloral hydrate 400 mg/kg i.p.) just before KA (1 mM) was applied to the neostriatum for 20 min from 100-120 min through the dialysis probe to the two KA-treated groups. Reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of 2- hydroxyterephthalate (OH-TA) in microdialysates was carried out using a Shimadzu instrument (Italia S.r.l., Milan, Italy) with a fluorescence detector (\u03bbex = 315 nm; \u03bbem = 435 nm) (Freinbichler et al., 2011).48 h after KA administration, animals were killed by decapitation, the brain removed, and the isolated neostriatum fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer solution for 72 h. Following paraffin inclusion, slices of the neostriatum (5 micron thick) were cut with a microtome. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Biotin-dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) immunohistochemistry, using the Klenow fragELMT DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit (Inalco, Milan, Italy), was applied to identify apoptotic nuclei. For Caspase-3 analysis, slices, after deparaffinization and rehydration, underwent permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by inactivation of endogenous peroxidase (30 min in 0.3% H2O2 in PBS) and serum blocking (5% donkey serum in PBS). They were then incubated overnight with the primary antibody (1:200 Anti-Active Caspase 3 (Promega)) and the next day for1 h with the secondary antibody (1:500 Biotin Conjugated Donkey Anti-rabbit p AB (Jackson ImmunoResearch)). For both TUNEL and Caspase-3, quantitative image analysis was performed using the public domain software Scion Image (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA) using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope (Nikon Instruments S.p.A., Firenze, Italy) equipped with a JVC SLR camera. For TUNEL and Caspase-3 analyses, three to six and three to four fields were counted respectively, corresponding to approximately 2000\u20135000 nuclei. For IBA1 immunolabeling to detect microglial activation, sections were first deparaffinized, gradually hydrated, and finally washed twice in 0.01M PBS solution pH 7.4. The tissue was first treated with 0.3% H2O2 for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity, then with 5% blocking donkey serum in PBS for 5 min to reduce background or unspecific staining. Sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibody (1:500, Anti-IBA1 (WAKO Chemicals GmbH, Germany)) diluted in 0.1M PBS, 5% donkey serum. The following day, sections were washed twice with PBS and then incubated for 10 min with the secondary antibody (1:500, Biotinylated anti-Rabbit IgG Antibody during brain microdialysis. Histochemical ex vivo tissue analysis was employed to assess related apoptotic striatal tissue damage.(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, USA)) in 0.1M PBS. The antigen-antibody complex was then visualized by the Vectastain ABC peroxidase kit (1:200, Vector Laboratories, USA). Finally, sections were washed and developed using 0.05% DAB (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy).",

Plate and liquid handling were performed using Echo 550, (Labcyte), Janus Automated Workstation, (PerkinElmer), Multidrop 384, (Thermo Scientific), Viaflo 384 (Integra Bioscience) and Multiflo FX Multi-Mode Dispenser (BioTek). Cell seeding and assay were carried out in black with clear bottom 384 well plates (BD Falcon, 353962). The Library and plating thereof was provided by the Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS). Images were acquired by either using ImageXpress Micro system (Molecular Devices LLC) with a 10 x objective or IN Cell Analyzer 2200 (GE Healthcare) with a 4 x objective and quantitative image analyses were run in CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) (Jones et al., 2008). Analysis of high content imagining data was performed using TIBCO Spotfire and additional statistical analyses were carried out with Microsoft Excel and Graphpad Prism softwares. For the primary HTS screening, U2OS cells were trypsinized and resuspended in culture medium. The cell suspension (500 cells in 25ml per well) was dispensed into 384-well plates (BD Falcon, 353962) and incubated overnight at 37 C in a5%CO2 atmosphere. The following day, 5 ml of 30 mM PR-peptide was added into the plates to get a final concentration of 5 mM of and, after 24h, 10 ml of a 40 mM solution in culture media of each of the compounds (kept at a 10 mM solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) were transferred to cells to keep a final compound concentration of 10 mM and a DMSO volume concentration of 0.1%. The cells were incubated for another 24h before fixation. Cells were fixed and stained with 2% formaldehyde and 2 mM Hoechst 33342 for 20 min, respectively. Plates were imaged using an IN Cell Analyzer 2200 system with a 4x objective. To identify compounds that prevent the cell death induced by PR20 peptides, 4-field images or 1-field images covering 100% of the well were taken for each treatment. All acquired images were analyzed with CellProfiler using a self-made pipeline that was based on detecting and counting Hoechst stained nuclei. Nuclei with a size smaller than 8 mm2 and with high intensity were not considered for count and thus excluded. The chemical collection used in the primary screening contained 4,126 pharmacologically active compounds from the following libraries: Prestwick, Tocris mini, Selleck tool compounds, Selleck known kinase inhibitors and ENZO tool compounds as well as 115 covalent drugs synthesized by Henriksson M. (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden). For the secondary \u2018\u2018epigenetic\u2019\u2019 screening, U2OS cells were seeded at 125 cells per well in 30 ml in 384-well plate (BD Falcon, 353962) and incubated overnight at 37 C in a5%CO2 atmosphere. The next day, either 10 ml of 40, 12 or 4 mMcompound was added into the plate to get 10, 3 or 1 mMof final concentration respectively. After 72h, the medium was changed to fresh medium containing 10, 3, or 1 mMcompound in a total volume of 40 ml and 24h later, 5 ml of 45 mMPR-peptide was added into each plate for an additional 48h to keep 5 mMof final concentration. After fixation with 100% ice-cold methanol for 5min, cells were subsequently counter-stained with 2 mM Hoechst 33342 for 20 min and the plate was scanned using IN Cell Analyzer 2200 (GE healthcare) with a 4 x objective. The chemical collection used in the secondary screening contained 94 epigenetics compounds consisting of the following libraries: ENZO Epigenetics v1.0 (43 compounds), Selleck tool compounds (HDAC) (11 compounds) and SGC bromodomain probe (40 compounds).",

A 1kb HB9 promoter fragment (gift from Hynek Wichterle) controlling the expression of myristoylated GFP was inserted into a donor plasmid specific for the AAVS1 locus (Sigma). Subsequently, 2.5 million iPS cells were single-cell dissociated using accutase and electroporated using the Neon transfection system (100ul tip; 1600V Voltage, 20ms Width, 1 Pulse; Life Technologies) with 2 g of AAVS1 ZFN plasmid and 6 g of modified AAVS1 donor plasmid. After nucleofection cells were plated on matrigel with mTeSR1 in the presence of ROCK inhibitor. After 48hrs, puromycin selection was applied and surviving clonal colonies were individually passaged and gDNA was extracted. PCR was used to confirm proper targeting of the cassette. Primer sequences are available upon request. Faithful expression of the reporter was verified using expression of the motor neuron marker Isl1 (Abcam (Ab109517), 1:1000) and the pan-neuronal marker Map2 (Milipore (MAB378), 1:1000).

Cell cultures were fed every 2-3 days with complete Neurobasal media containing L-glutamine, NEAA, glutamax, N2 and B27, with BDNF/CNTF/GDNF (10 ng/mL, R&D) and ascorbic acid (0.2 ug/mL, Sigma). After 14 days, the cultures were transduced with synapsin-MitoDSred lentivitrus and used for subsequent mitochondrial movement kinetics experiments.",

After 24 h incubation with the compounds, MG132 was added at a final concentration of 100 nM. MG132 is a well-characterized proteasome inhibitor, which would be expected to enhance the appearance of protein aggregation by blocking the proteosomal clearance of aggregated proteins. Cell viability was measured 48 h later using the fluorescent viability probe, Calcein-AM (Molecular Probes). Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS, Calcein-AM was added at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcM for 20 min at room temperature, and fluorescence intensity was read in a POLARstar fluorescence plate reader (BMG). Fluorescence data were coupled with compound structural data, then stored and analyzed using the CambridgeSoft Chemoffice Enterprise Ultra software package.",

The mice purchased from Jackson were not used immediately. The SOD1(G93A) male from Jackson mated with wild-type C57Bl/6 female, then male offspring were always mated with wild-type C57Bl/6 female mice. The resulting animals are on a background that involves C57BL/6 and SJL and express high levels of human SOD1 gene carrying a glycine to alanine transition at position 93 (G93A). The animal protocol used was approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute. Mice were treated from postnatal day 60 until the endpoints by i.p. injections with either 123C4 or the saline control. 123C4 was dissolved in normal saline at a concentration of 2 mg/mL and sterilized by a 0.2 \u03bcm filter. Mice were treated with 123C4 every day, at a dose of 30 mg/kg of body weight. Animals were assessed daily for the time of onset of hind limb tremor and loss of splay reflex. The endpoint was designated as the point when the mouse could no longer roll over within 10s after being pushed onto its side. At this stage, mice were killed. Disease onset and survival time were compared using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method.

Motor neuron cell with staining in the anterior horn of the lumbar spinal cord was counted. To evaluate the effect of GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition on the ALS mice model, western blotting of GSK-3\u03b2, phospho-GSK- 3\u03b2 and antibodies of extrinsic apoptosis signals was performed. For western blotting, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and intracardiac perfusion of PBS was carried out. Subsequently, the spinal cord of eachmouse was quickly removed, cooled in ice-cold artificial CSF for 5min, and stored in a \u221280 \u00b0C freezer. The spinal cord was homogenized with a 1.0 ml homogenizer and type B pestle in a 10:1 volume/weight buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mM EGTA, 250 mMsucrose, 2 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin, 5 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin, 2 \u03bcg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Tissue lysates were centrifuged at 17,000\u00d7g for 10 min, and the supernatants were used for the evaluation of GSK-3\u03b2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), phospho- GSK-3\u03b2 (Cell Signaling Tech, Beverly,MA, USA), FAS (Santa Cruz Biotech, Delaware, CA, USA), FADD (Santa Cruz Biotech, Delaware, CA, USA) and Caspase 8 (Cell Signaling Tech, Beverly, MA, USA).",

CPN-9 was suspended in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-Na (carmellose sodium, Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), while WN1303R, WN1312 and WN1316 were dissolved in Milli-Q purified water (MQ water) and WN1315 was dissolved in 0.25 N HCl. CPN-9 (100 mg/kg body weight) and the four WN-compounds (50 mg/kg body weight) were injected intragastrically (i.g.). After 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, and 8 h, blood was collected from heart of each mouse anesthetized with 2% isoflurane by inhalation or 4% halothane in a mixture of N2O/O2 (70:30). Mice were thereafter perfused transcardially with physiological saline containing 10% heparin under anesthesia, and the whole brain was removed. Each blood sample was centrifuged at 1,0006g for 10 min at 4uC, and the serum fraction was collected. The brain was frozen in liquid nitrogen, and was cryopreserved until use. We mixed serum with deproteinization buffer (0.05 M H2SO4, 2.5 M K2CO3, and diethylester), and collected the organic layer after centrifugation at 1,5006g for 10 min. The organic layer was mixed with 0.05 M H2SO4, and then, after centrifugation at 1,5006g for 10 min, the water layer was collected. After the addition of methanol, each serum derived sample was subjected to HPLC. Mouse whole brain was homogenized with acetonitrile and left at 280uC for 10 min. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 10,0006g for 10 min at 4uC and was dried under vacuum. The dried sample was re-dissolved in methanol and mixed with two volumes of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH7.0), after which the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 10,0006g for 10 min at 4uC and then left at 280uC for 10 min. To further remove debris, the supernatant was filtered (0.45 mm filter), centrifuged (at 10,0006g for 10 min at 4uC), filtered (0.22 mm filter) and finally centrifuged again. Each sample solution from brain was subjected to HPLC. The concentrations of CPN-9 and WN1316 in the serum and brain samples were determined by HPLC on a CAPCELL PAK C18 column (SHISEIDO) with 50% acetonitrile (CPN-9), 40% acetonitrile (WN1316) or 45% acetonitrile (WN1303R, WN1312, and WN1315) in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0).",

Grip strength test was assessed using a traction meter (BrainScience Idea Co., Ltd.). Each mouse was given three trials, and the highest limb strength score was recorded. For ALS(SOD1G93A) transgenic mice, grip strength tests were started at 11 weeks of age and performed twice a week until an over 20% reduction compared with the initial limb strength score at 11 weeks of age was observed. Finally, a grade 3 in the balance beam test [10] and over 20% reduction of limb strength score were defined as the sign of the disease onset in ALS(SOD1G93A) transgenic mice",

In brief, the balance-beam test was performed every day after the onset until mice were unable to stay on the bar. Each mouse was given a maximum of five vertical pole trials using the following two criteria; 1) a cutoff of 45cm and 2) the task was terminated when mouse reached the vertical ascending distance of 45 cm. The highest vertical ascending distance was scored. The footprint trial was conducted at 18 and 21 weeks of age in ALS(SOD1H46R) mice and at 12, 16, and 20 weeks of age in ALS(SOD1G93A) mice. Grip strength test of ALS(SOD1H46R) mice was started at 17 weeks of age and performed once a week. To evaluate the spontaneous motor activities in mice, we conducted cage activity and rearing performance tests by using SUPERMEX with infrared ray sensor monitor (Muromachi Kikai). Both cage activity and rearing performance were monitored for 2 consecutive nights starting at 18 weeks and 21 weeks of age in ALS(SOD1H46R) mice and at 13 weeks, 17 weeks and 21 weeks of age in ALS(SOD1G93A) mice. The cumulative counts of cage activity and rearing performance for the darkperiod (12 h; 19:00\u20137:00) were analyzed.

Finally, the normalized ranks of the p-values for all drug pairs were used as drug\u2013drug similarity measures to reduce the heterogeneity of the p-value distributions for different laboratory tests. We assume that different laboratory tests may be related to specific physiological characteristics of distinct diseases or drugs. Thus, we calculated the similarity degree of disease or drug pairs using each test type separately. For the sparseness of laboratory test results, we here only used major types of laboratory test based on their high coverage of drug prescribed patient ($0.3) having more than two test results during drug administration ordered (jQk d,pj$2) (Table 2). Since only 1 K of cases prescribed one single drug, we selected cases which include less than five drug prescription records to maximize drug associated laboratory results with reduced expected disruptions of a drug induced laboratory test results by other drugs (Table 2).",

In addition, drug_start(p) represents the initial time of drug administration for case p. The time resolution of our EMR data was one day. Most drugs were prescribed after diagnosis, so we also included laboratory test results recorded on the same date as drug initiation; i.e., x#drug_start(p). In equation (2), this study utilized diagnose(p) as a single diagnose code, which was assigned before the initial drug prescription recorded, and all of diagnose record missing cases were filtered in preprocess procedure of our EMR database. Although equation (2) determines various diagnose states including multi-morbidity condition, we independently utilized diagnose(p) as a single diagnose code for each case to generate distribution of disease associate laboratory test results to prepare larger number of cases for each disease.

Because the heterogeneous genetic background of the study mice results in significantly different survival times between males and females (Heiman-Patterson et al., 2003), male mice were used in all experiments. In the present experiment, mice were fed Purina 5002 (Purina Mills, St. Louis, MO) rodent chow\u00a0ad libitum, supplemented with 240 ppm pioglitazone (ActosTM; Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Osaka, Japan). The latter drug concentration was chosen because only 18% of pioglitazone crosses the blood-brain barrier in mammals as described in detail by others (Maeshiba et al., 1997). The final dosage of drug was computed to be 40 mg \u00b7 kg-1\u00a0\u00b7 d-\u00a0of pioglitazone based on an average daily food consumption of 5 g of chow per mouse. Of note, pioglitazone does not affect blood glucose levels in mice as determined in a set of pilot experiments using the identical treatment protocol in accordance with previous observations in nondiabetic mice (Shiomi et al., 2002).",

The mice were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and killed by cervical dislocation. Two different dissection, fixation, and staining protocols were used. First, for bright-field motor neuron immunohistochemistry, the lumbar parts of the spinal cord were dissected out quickly and immersion fixed in Bouin Hollande fixative, containing 4% (w/v) picric acid, 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde, and 1% (v/v) glacial acetic acid. The tissue was embedded in paraffin, cut with a microtome at 7 \u03bcm thickness, and mounted on silanized glass slides. Sections were then stained for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity essentially as described in detail previously (Schutz et al., 2004). For the quantification of motor neurons, CGRP-positive cell bodies were counted on six sections per animal and the mean number per section calculated. To avoid false double counting, the sections were 49 \u03bcm apart from each other. Immunohistochemical detection of microglia was performed by staining with a rat monoclonal antibody against murine CD11b (diluted 1:250; catalog #MCA711; Serotec, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany) and visualized by using the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method (ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. For quantification, the microglia were subdivided into three activation states (resting, intermediate, activated) according to their morphological appearance and the number quantified per section.Second, for the simultaneous fluorescent immunohistochemical detection of motor neurons and microglia, freshly dissected pieces of lumbar spinal cord were frozen quickly in isopentane at -40\u00b0C. Eight micrometer sections were cut with a cryostat and mounted on silanized glass slides. The slides were dried at room temperature overnight and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Retrieval of antigen sites, blocking of endogenous peroxidase activity, and blocking of nonspecific binding sites was performed according to standard protocols. Double staining was performed by adding simultaneously both first antibodies followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C. Immunoreactions were visualized with goat secondary antibodies (cyanine 3-conjugated anti-rabbit, diluted 1:150; Alexa488-conjugated anti-rat, diluted 1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Negative controls included omission of the primary and secondary antibodies.\n\nEvaluation of the spinal cord motor neuron area by CGRP immunohistochemistry",

[Thisroute of exposure and these doses were recommendedby Neotherapeutics based on preclinical studies, andbracket doses found effective in other animal models (DrEve Taylor, Neotherapeutics, personal communication)].Daily intake of fluid was not affected by treatment andaveraged 6-7 ml/d per mouse, and calculated AIT-082intake per treatment group was 0, 1,3, 10,30,60, 100 mg!kg/d AIT-082 respectively. A minimum of 12 animals pertreatment group were targeted, as suggested by Gurney forthis model (33). Litter mates were distributed uniformlybetween groups, which resulted in slight variation in groupnumbers. To contain cost, we housed groups 0, 3, 30, 100mg/kg individually in the running wheel cages (n = 12per group), and groups I, 10, 60 mg/kg individually instandard cages (n= 13, II, 17 respectively). Disease onset,distance run (where applicable) and death were recorded.In the time-response experiment, we treated G93A SOD-Itransgenic mice with 100 mg/l (30 mg/kg) AIT-082 in thedrinking water, beginning at ages 20, 30, 40, 60, 80 days,or with 0 mg/kg (control), (n=12 per group).Age at onset of signs and age at death were tabulatedby the method of Kaplan and Meier, and treatmentgroups were compared to control using a log-rank testof significance and log-rank test for significance of trend.(This is equivalent to exploring a linear dose-responserelationship. We did not explore quadratic or othermodels of dose-response.) We also calculated the timefrom disease onset of signs to death, as an additionaloutcome measure. Outcome measures were stratifiedby sex and by exercise (wheel in cage or not), and theanalysis was further refined using Cox regression, withtreatment group, sex, and exercise (wheel in cage or not)as covariates. For those groups in running wheels, thenumber of wheel-turns per half hour was averaged over aweek, and the weekly average for each treated group wascompared to control using a t test (planned comparison).",

In a previous study using BDNF, we reported the dose-dependent effect of the subcutaneous administration of BDNF between 5 and 20 mg/kg, the latter of which was optimal [23]. Thus, in thisinvestigation, we performed a blinded study with vehicle(phosphate-buffered saline, PBS), 5, 20, and 40 mg/kgBDNF (n = 10 for each group) to observe the reproducibility and the maximal effects of BDNF. Riluzole study 1 was anopen-label study with a vehicle control and 100 and 200 Ag/ml riluzole for 2 weeks (n = 4, 5, and 5, respectively), which was performed to determine an effective dose of riluzole for improving grip strength and to measure the serum concentration of riluzole after 2 weeks of treatment. In this study,the normal littermates that were kept in pairs with the wobbler mice were also tested for grip strength and theserum concentration of riluzole, for comparisons with the affected wobbler mice. Riluzole study 2 was a blinded studyusing a vehicle control and 200 Ag/ml riluzole for 4 weeks (n = 10 for each group), to examine the effects of riluzole onbody weight, grip strength, rota-rod walking performance,the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) of the affected forelimb biceps and the numberof the cervical cord anterior horn neurons that were immuno reactivefor SMI-32. Because the CMAP amplitude inwobbler mice has not been reported in previous studies, we examined the natural history of the CMAP amplitude using additional untreated wobbler mice and normal littermates at the clinical onset, and 2 and 4 weeks after the onset (five wobbler mice and five normal littermates were used at eachtime point).",

After incubatedon ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 14 000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min, wholeprotein solution was collected and the concentrations were determinedby BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) using bovine serum albuminas a standard. Cell lysates were diluted in the SDS sample buffer, andthe mixture was boiled for 5 min. The proteins (30 \u03bcg) was separated ona 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidenefluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked for 2 h at roomtemperature in 5% powdered nonfat milk in a TBST solution (20 mMTris, pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween 20).

After that, the membranes were washed andthen incubated with the respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugatedsecondary antibody (1:2000). Blots were developed by using a SuperEnhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,IL) for 5 min, the protein bands were visualized after exposure ofthe blots to the imaging system Azure C600 (Azure Biosystems, Dublin,CA, USA).

The time was automatically stopped if the mouse fell from the rod or after anarbitrary limit of 420 s (Li et al., 2000). Mice were tested once a week until they could no longer perform the task. An examiner who was blinded to the experimental design assessed the motor functions of the mice mentioned above.The onset of motor dysfunction was defined as the first day when a mouse could not remain on the Rotarod for 420 s at a speed of 20 rpm, as described previously (Li et al., 2000).The life span was defined as the postnatal day when the mouse died (Shefner et al., 2001).

Gross behavior of each animal was daily observed through visual inspection. In particular, hind limb movement and rearing behavior of each animal were weekly monitored by video camera from 12 weeks of age to the end stage. To determine the age at onset of motor dysfunction in transgenic mice, we adopted a balance beam test using the stainless steel bar (45 cm long and 0.9 cm indiameter). Motor function in the hind limbs was assessed at 12 weeks ofage, and weekly thereafter until the day at which mice were unable to stay on the bar.We used the following five arbitrary grades to evaluate the motor function of mice; grade 5 (enable to walk and change the directions on the bar without their hind limb slipping), grade 4 (occasionally showed a sign of hind limb slipping, but skill fully walk on the bar), grade 3(frequently showed a hind limb slipping, but still awkwardly walked on the bar), grade 2 (stay on the bar, but quickly fall off from the bar when attempt to walk), and grade 1 (unable to stay on the bar). In this study, the grade 3 was defined as the sign of the disease onset. Lifespan of animals was determined by the observations that mice have no longer had a heartbeat and breathing, and survival interval was calculated by the subtraction of the day of life span by the day of disease onset.",

In the present study, we used a total of 94 mice and allocated them to the following two groups; 62 mice of 94 were used for behavior and survival analyses (survival study) and the remaining mice were for biochemical study (Fig. 1).For the survival study, a group of 62 mice, either SOD1G93A or NTG, was randomly assigned to receive a daily intraperitoneal administration with a volume of 0.3 mL of either TTM (TTM group, n=34) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS group, used as a control, n=28). TTM(Kanto Chemical Co., Tokyo) was dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4), and a fresh solution was prepared daily, since TTM was subject to be degraded to molybdate and sulfide at an acidic pH (Ogura et al.,1999). TTM at a dose of 5 mg/kg or the same volume of PBS was administered to each mouse.Treatment was started at 4 weeks of age, before the SOD1G93A mice began to exhibit ALS-like symptoms. The administration was continued until the end-point, which was defined in Clinical assessments.For the biochemical study, another group of 32 mice, either SOD1G93A or NTG, was also randomly allocated to the TTM group (n=17) or the PBS treatment group (used as a control, n=15). At the ageof 18 weeks, nearly equal to the end-stage of disease in PBS-treated SOD1G93A, the mice were killed by decapitation under light anesthesia with ether, according to the guidelines of the Ethics Committee for Laboratory Animal Use at the College of Pharmacy, Nihon University.The genotype of each mouse was identified, and the whole spinal cords which is responsible region for the disease, were dissected out and preserved at \u221280 \u00b0C for the following biochemical analyses.",

For the next randomized control study, we arbitrarily determinedto analyze 15 female animals per group.We crossed 8 F4 Tg male miceand 24 F4 non-Tg female mice, and generated 182 F5 offsprings. The semice were sequentially numbered before their gender and geno type had been determined. Later, we identified 45 female mSOD1 Tg mice among them. We observed their behavior for 2 months, ascertained that no mouse showed developmental or behavioral abnormality, and enrolled all of them in the study. The identification numbers of theen rolled mice were thus not sequential. The controller of the studyconfidentially assigned each mouse in numerical order into one of 3groups receiving different doses of edaravone, i.e., 0 mg/kg (vehicle),5 mg/kg, and 15 mg/kg (n=15 for each group). These doses were determined from the data obtained from the pharmacokinetic analysis. This automatic procedure of randomization thoroughly eliminated the controller's bias, and concurrently made it difficult to imagine the dose of edaravone for each mouse by its number.Moreover, littermate Tg mice, if any, were evenly assigned into different groups. The researchers who participated in this study were divided into 2 groups that remained the same throughout the study; the members o fone group were specialized for the edaravone administration; and those of the other, for behavioral observation. They were strictly blind to the information obtained by the other group members until the death of all mice.The behavioral observers visited the animal facility every day during the dark period to be with the mice during their active period and examined their motor functions, starting presymptomatically when the mice were 70 days of age. Each mouse was trained to stay ona Rotarod (Natsume Seisakusho Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) rotating at speeds of 20, 15 or 8 rpm (Li et al., 2000). The time each mouse remained on the rod was registered automatically. If a mouse persistedon the rod for 7 min within 3 repetitions, its test was completed and scored as 420 s. However, many of the mice could not remain on therod rotating at 20 rpm for 7 min during the presymptomatic period. Onthe other hand, all 45 mice could remain on the 15-rpm rotating rod for 7 min successfully within 3 trials. Therefore, the onset of the hindlimb weakness symptom in each mouse was defined to be the earliest day when multiple observers identified the manifestation of a leg tremor on 2 consecutive days when the mouse was suspended by itstail or when it failed the 15-rpm Rotarod task for 2 consecutive days.For most of the mice, the interval between those days was less than2 days.Since the onset day was determined for each mouse, the administration group members started the intraperitoneal injectionof edaravone or of the saline every day during the daytime. Thebehavioral observers examined each mouse every night, using ouroriginal motor performance score described below. Their bodyweight,the length of time they remained on the 8-rpm rotating Rotarod, andthe grip strength of their fore limbs assessed by using a Digital GripStrength Meter (Columbus Instruments, OH, USA) (Guo et al., 2003)were measured twice a week. Three repetitions were made for eachmeasurement, and the maximum was determined for each mouse.The total motor performance score consisted of 4 parts, each with acertain numerical score or points defined as follows: hind limbs: 3, noweakness; 2, one leg paresis (a leg tremor when the mouse was hanged by its tail); 1, paraparesis (both legs were weak, but stillmovable); 0, paraplegia (no leg movement). Fore limbs: 3, noweakness; 2, paresis (being able to grasp a Pull Bar but weakly); 1, plegia (being unable to grasp a Pull Bar, but able to keep its chestabove the floor); 0, unable to lift up its chest from the floor. Trunk: 1,able to twist its trunk when falling from the Rotarod; 0, unable to doso. Total body motility: 3, able to run; 2, able to walk or crawl; 1:able to right itself; 0, unable to right itself within 30 s. The score for each category was summed, and the mice with 10 points were considered to be normal clinically, whereas those with 0 points were regarded as being unable to feed themselves.The mice were sacrificed under anesthesia when they had lost the ability to right themselves within 30 s after having been placed ontheir sides.",

        "text": "Neuropathologic examination and 3-nitrotyrosine assay. In the next part of our study, to obtain neuropathologic andbiochemical evidence for significant favorable effects of edaravone onthe motor functions of the ALS mice, we treated female cohort groups with edaravone exactly as in the blind study and then sacrificed themat the 10th day after the injection of edaravone. Non-treated controlfemale mice were also sacrificed at the same time to provide age matched tissues for comparison. The time point of the 10th day waschosen, because at that time 15-mg/kg edaravone significantlypreserved the hind limb function demonstrated by the Rotarod taskin the blind study.Under deep anesthesia with diethyl ether, 3 mice each of the 3different dose groups were perfused through a cardiac cannula with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline as a fixative,and their spinal cords were processed for neuropathologic examination.As controls, 3 wild-type and 3 non-injected Tg female mice were sacrificed at the same time. Additionally, for biochemical assays, 2similarly anesthetized mice from each of the 3 treatment groups weresacrificed without fixation. Their spinal cords were immediatelydissected and stored in a deep freezer. Three unfixed spinal cords fromnon-treated wild-type mice served as controls.For quantitative neuropathologic examination, the spinal cord atthe level of L2 to L4 was sampled from each mouse, embedded inparaffin, and sectioned sequentially throughout into sections of 20-\u03bcmthickness. Approximately 60 to 100 sections of each mouse wereprocessed for Nissl staining. Neuropathologists unaware of theidentity of the sections counted the number of motoneurons in thesciatic motor pool (Lowrie et al., 1987; Kieran et al., 2004) in eachanterior horn of all sections, and the obtained numbers were averaged. In order to avoid counting the same neuron twice inconsecutive sections, only those cells in which the nucleolus wasclearly visible at higher magnification were included in the counts(Lowrie et al., 1987).The quantitative analysis of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and tyrosine inthe spinal cords was performed by using high-performance liquidchromatography with 16-electrode electrochemical detection, asdescribed in a previous report (Ferrante et al., 1997).In addition, to assess the effect of edaravone on the accumulationof 3-NT and SOD1, we rehydrated every 5th Nissl-stained sectionfrom each mouse after having counted the number of motoneurons and immunostained it with monoclonal antibody against 3-NT(1:100; Abcam plc., Cambridge, UK); and the section preceding each of these sections was also rehydrated and then stained with monoclonal anti-SOD1 antibody (1:50; NeoMarkers, CA, USA). Thenumber of \u201cdouble\u201d sections examined for each mouse varied, but 12 were the minimum number. Bound primary antibody was detected with the appropriate Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories,Burlingame, CA, USA); and 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzine tetrahydrochloridewas used as the chromogen. The total area of abnormal SOD1 deposition in each anterior horn was measured in blind fashion byneuropathologists using FvlFs image filing software (FLOVEL Co. Ltd.,Tokyo, Japan), and were averaged for each mouse. The stainingspecificity was assessed by replacing the primary antibody withphosphate-buffered saline solution containing 3% bovine serumalbumin (PBS-BSA). No deposits of reaction products were seen inthe sections thus treated.",

As previously described, onset of clinical disease was determinedby the weakening of the sensori-motor ability at the rotarod test andby changes in the hind limb contraction when mice were suspendedby their tail ( Gurney et al., 1996; Kriz et al., 2002, 2003; Keller et al.,2009). A Rotarod test was used to evaluate the motor performance of the mice using an accelerating paradigm of 0.1 rpm/s. After a learning period of several days, mice were able to stay on the rotarod for up to180 s. Each mouse was given 2 trials of a maximum of 180 s and thebest performance was used as a measure for motor ability. Mice were tested once a week from age of 6 week-old until they could no longer perform the task and were sacrificed when they started to lie on the side, to express difficulties in grooming and could not right themselves within 30 s when placed on their back (Gurney et al.,1996; Kriz et al., 2002). displayed in physical units of surface radiance, photons per second per centimetre squared per steradian (photons/sec/cm2/sr).

In order to estimate the stability of the solution, samples were analyzed up to 1 week after the preparation of the solution. To evaluate the passage of salicylate into the brain, 14 FALS and 14 wt mice were given access to the lysine acetylsalicylate solution for 3 weeks (see Table 1 for the treatment schedule). The day before sacrifice, the animals were deprived of drinking water. Three hours before sacrifice, the animals had access to either water or lysine acetylsalicylate. It was necessary to control the period of time preceding sacrifice during which the animals had access to drug solution because brain salicylate was no longer detectable 3 h after an i.p. administration of LAS (unpublished observation). Again, intake of water or LAS solution was estimated by weighing the drink bottles before and after the 3-h period. Finally, the brains were removed and stored at 280\u00b0C until analysis. Frozen left hemispheres were sonicated in 500 \u03bcl of 0.05 M HClO4 containing 0.5 mM of EDTA (LABOSI) and 2 mM sodium metabisulfite. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted in 12 vol of HClO4-EDTA solution and 50 \u03bcl were injected onto the liquid chromatography column using a refrigerated (4\u00b0C) autoinjector Wisp 712 (Waters, Milford, MA). Separation was achieved at room temperature. The high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisted of a pump, a stainless separation column (0.46 3 7 cm) packed with an Ultrasphere XL ODS C18, 3-\u03bcm particle size (Beckman, Fullertone, CA). The mobile phase contained 0.05 M NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM octane sulfonic acid, 4% CH3CN, pH 3. The flow rate was 0.9 ml/min. The detection was carried out by means of a Coulometric detector (model 5100A; ESA, Bedford, MA) equipped with dual analytical cells set at 0.25 and 0.75 V. Concentrations of each compound were calculated using a computing integrator (Maxima, Waters) with reference calibration curves obtained after injection of standards.",

The clinical condition of micewas monitored two to three times per week according tothe procedures used by Gurney and co-workers (32; seealso 15) starting at 2 months of age. In brief, the onsetof clinical signs was scored by examining the mice for shaking limbs and/or examining the position of one orboth back legs (hanging rather than splaying out) whenthe mice were suspended in the air by their tail. Theonset of clinical disease was determined to be the age(days) at which loss of splay and/or tremors of hindlimbswere observed in the mice and occurs approximatelybetween 2 and 3 months of age for the G1H/1mice and between 6.5 and 8 months of age for theG1L/1 mice (15, 29, 32). Examining the mice for therighting reflex scored the end-stage of the disease. Themice were sacrificed if they could not right themselveswithin 30 s when placed on their sides on a flat surface.The end-stage of the disease occurs approximatelybetween 4 and 5 months of age for the G1H/1 mice andbetween 8 and 9 months of age for the G1L/1 mice (29,32). The animals were randomly numbered and assignedto the treatment groups before the clinicalcondition of the mice was examined. The neurologicalsigns for determining the onset and end-stage of diseasewere thus scored in a semiblinded manner.The motor ability of the mice was quantified bymeasuring stride length and monitored two times perweek according to the procedures used by Gurney et al.(32; see also 15). The age at which clinical weaknessdeveloped was defined as the age at which stride lengthshortening occurred. To measure stride length, micewere trained to walk in a 50-cm tube that was inclinedat one end to a height of 16 cm, darkened at one end. Torecord their tracks, hindfeet of the mice were paintedwith nontoxic, poster paints (contrasting colors), andtheir tracks were imprinted on paper (labeled with onlythe number of the animal and date) lining the floor ofthe tube. Stride length was measured manually andwas defined as the distance between successive right-torightand left-to-left footprints. As the disease progresses,the painted footprints became increasinglysmeared on the paper, which correlated with previousresults (52). The onset of clinical weakness was quantifiedby determining the age at which shortening of thestride length occurred. Because only the number of therandomized animal and date identified the recordedtracks, the measurement of stride length was determinedin a blinded manner. In addition, the bodyweights of the animals were measured two times perweek, as weight loss is a symptom of near end-stageFALS (15, 32).",

The Rotarod apparatus (KN-75, Natsume Seisakusho, Tokyo, Japan) was used to assess motor performance, coordination, and balance on small animals (Karl et al.,2003). Rotarod performance was assessed twice a week in Tg (SOD1-G93A) micestarting from 70 days postnatally. Mice were trained for 2e3 days (8 rpm   5 trails)to get acquainted with the Rotarod apparatus. The testing began by placing each mouse on the rod rotating at 12 rpm, and the time that a mouse stayed on the rod(seconds, a maximum of 180 s) was recorded as a measurement of the competence of motor function. Three trials were performed and the best result of the three was recorded.",

Electromyography (EMG)wasmeasured using a Nicolet Viking IV (Nicolet, Charles,Missouri, USA)EMG recorder according the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (10 ml/kg, intraperitoneal injection, i.p.)and normal body temperature was maintained with a heating lamp. Compound muscle amplitude potential (CMAP) was measured by inserting a ground needle electrode (Nicolet Fp581) on the back of the mouse, an anode needle at the base of the tail, and a reference needle electrode near the Achille\u2019s tendon.When the sciatic nerve was given a stimulus at a paraspinal site using a 0.2-ms/1-Hz supra-maximal single pulse through a needle electrode (Nicolet Fp581), the evoked amplitude of the CMAPwas recorded fromthemedial part of the gastrocnemius muscle with a unipolar needle electrode. Once the recording was validated by an initial negative deflection and biphasic waveform, a series of stimuli with gradually increased intensity were applied to assess the supra-maximal stimulus. After the intensity of stimulation was saturated,the peak-to-peak amplitude of CMAP was recorded.A modified statistical method of motor unit number estimation (MUNE) was performed as previously described (Shefner et al., 2007). Briefly, once a CMAP was measured through supra-maximal stimulation, a stimulus-response curve was obtainedby delivering 30 computer-controlled stimuli with gradually increased intensity.Any peak over 10% of the total CMAP was investigated to determine the responseof a single large-amplitude motor unit. Four response ranges were chosen and were:10%e20%, 25%e35%, 40%e50% and 55e65% of maximal response. The weightedaveragemethod was used to calculated average single motor unit potential (SMUP).A MUNE was obtained from [CMAP]/[SMUP].\n\nEffect of DL-NBP treatment on electromyographical parameters.",

        "text": "2.3. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) recordings. Acute hippocampal slices were prepared from pre-symptomatic andsymptomatic SOD1G93A mice, and from age-matched WT mice, as routinelydone in our lab (Jer\u00f3nimo-Santos et al., 2015). Briefly, afteranimals were sacrificed by cervical displacement, hippocampi weredissected in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) solution(composition: 124 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mMNaHCO3, 1 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4)previously gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Hippocampal slices(400 \u03bcm thick), were cut perpendicularly to the long axis of the hippocampususing a McIlwain tissue chopper. Slices were allowed tofunctionally and energetically recover for at least 1 h in a restingchamber filled with aCSF solution continuously gassed with 95% O2and 5% CO2, at room temperature (22-25 \u00b0C). After the recovery period,slices were transferred to a recording chamber with 1 mL capacity plus5 mL dead volume, staying completely submerged and continuouslysuperfused with gassed aCSF solution at a constant flow (3 mL/min)and temperature (32 \u00b0C).Field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings wereobtained through a microelectrode (4\u20138M\u038f resistance) filled with aCSFsolution, placed in stratum radiatum of CA1 region of the hippocampus.Two pathways of the Schaffer collateral (SC)/commissural fibers werealternately stimulated (rectangular pulses of 0.1 ms duration) every15 s (for input\u2013output [I/O] curves and paired-pulse facilitation [PPF]recordings) or every 20 s (for LTP recordings), using a bipolar concentricwire electrode. The averages of 6 consecutive responses to thesame stimulus intensity delivered to the same pathway were obtainedthroughout the experiments, and the slope of the initial phase of eachaveraged fEPSP was quantified. Recordings were obtained with anAxoclamp 2B amplifier (10 Vm output; Axon Instruments, Foster City,CA, USA), which automatically selects 3 dB frequency single pole lowpassfilter, digitized (BNC-2110, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA)at a sampling frequency of 20 KHz (1 per 0.05 ms) and continuouslystored on a personal computer with WinLTP software (Anderson andCollingridge, 2001). All the protocols detailed below were started onlyafter a stable baseline of at least 15 min.Since each slice allows recordings from two independent pathways,the usual protocol was to record first PPF data by stimulation of onepathway, then I/O data by stimulating the second pathway, then posttetanicpotentiation (PTP) and LTP data by again delivering stimulationto the first pathway. While recording fEPSPs for the LTP assays, we keptbasal stimulation (one stimulus every 20sec) to the non-theta bust stimulatedpathway to allow assessment of the viability of the slice as wellas the independency between the two pathways.",

Long term potentiation (LTP) and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). \u03b8-burst stimulation was used to induce LTP, since this pattern ofstimulation is considered closer to what occurs physiologically in the hippocampus during episodes of learning and memory in living animals(Albensi et al., 2007). After obtaining a stable recording of the fEPSPslope, a \u03b8-burst of stimuli, consisting of 1 train of 4 bursts (200 msinterburst interval), each burst being composed by 4 pulses delivered at100 Hz [1 x (4 x 4)], was applied, and the stimulus paradigm was thenresumed to pre-burst conditions until the end of the recording period(60 min after burst stimulation). LTP magnitude was quantified as the% change in the average slope of the fEPSP taken from 50 to 60 minafter the induction of LTP as compared with the average slope of thefEPSP measured during the 10 min before LTP induction. PTP was assessedas the average fEPSP slope obtained in the first 4 min after LTPinduction (Habets and Borst, 2007).",

Experiments were performed in acute transverse hippocampal slicestaken from pre-symptomatic and symptomatic SOD1G93A mice and agematchedWT mice.Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane before decapitation.Transverse slices (300 \u03bcm thick) were obtained with a vibratome(VT1000 S; Leica, Nussloch, Germany) in ice cold dissecting solutioncontaining (in mM) 110 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2, 25NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, and 7 D-glucose, oxygenated with 95% O2and 5% CO2, pH 7.4. Slices were incubated in aCSF solution (composition:124 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3,1 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) at 35 \u00b0C for30 min and then maintained at room temperature for at least 60 mincontinuously gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. After the recoveryperiod, each slice was transferred to a recording chamber, continuouslysuperfused with aCSF solution at 3 mL/min at room temperature forrecording.Visually guided whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performedfrom CA1 neurons using a Carl Zeiss Axioskop 2FS uprightmicroscope (Jena, Germany) equipped with a differential interferencecontrast-infrared (DIC-IR) CCD video camera (VX44, Till Photonics,Gr\u00e4felfing, Germany) and recorded with an Axopatch 200B (AxonInstruments, Foster City, CA, USA) amplifier. Patch pipettes (4\u20139 M\u03a9)were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5 mm outer diameter,0.86 mm inner diameter, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) withPC-10 Puller (Narishige Group, London, UK) and filled with an internalsolution containing (in mM): 125 CsCl, 8 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 10HEPES, 10 glucose, 5 Mg ATP, and 0.4 NaGTP, pH 7.2, adjusted withCsOH (50 wt% in H2O), 280\u2013290 mOsm; for EPSCAMPA recordings,0.1 mM spermine was added.All recordings were performed in the continuous presence of picrotoxin(50 \u03bcM) to block GABAergic transmission. Stimuli (0.2 msrectangular pulses every 15 s) were delivered via monopolar stimulationwith a patch-type pipette filled with aCSF and positioned in stratumradiatum. NMDA/AMPA ratios were calculated to check for changes inAMPA or NMDA currents and were obtained from experiments whereEPSCs at Vh = \u221270mV and Vh = +40 mV were alternately recorded.Peak current amplitude recorded at Vh = \u221270mV was taken as anestimate of AMPAR activation. Since currents at Vh = +40 mV arecomposed of AMPA and NMDA currents, NMDA currents were notmeasured at peak but at 60 ms after AMPA peak at Vh = \u221270 mV,where AMPA currents are already negligible.EPSCNMDA and EPSCAMPA were recorded in another set of experimentswhere currents were pharmacologically isolated by adding to theaCSF supplemented with picrotoxin (50 \u03bcM), CNQX (25 \u03bcM) or APV(50 \u03bcM), respectively. Current/voltage relationships (I/V plots) wereobtained from experiments where Vh was alternated from \u221270mV to+50 mV (EPSCAMPA) or \u221290mV to +50 mV (EPSCNMDA) with gaps of10 mV in-between steps. To allow data pooling from different experiments,EPSCs amplitudes were normalized in each experiment bytaking as 1 the peak amplitude recorded at \u221270 mV (EPSCAMPA) or+50 mV (EPSCNMDA). The rectification index (EPSC+50/EPSC-70mV)for either EPSCNMDA or EPSCAMPA currents was calculated by the ratioof peak EPSPs amplitudes recorded at a Vh = +50 mV over the peakcurrent amplitude recorded at Vh = \u221270mV.Acquired signals were filtered using an in-built, 2-kHz, 3-pole Besselfilter, and data were digitized at 10 kHz under control of the pCLAMP11 (Molecular Devices, San Jos\u00e9, CA, USA) software program. Offsetpotentials were nulled before giga-seal formation. Small voltage steps(\u22125 mV, 50 ms) were used to monitor the access resistance throughoutrecording and experiments in which this parameter varied by more than20% were discarded.",

KW-6002 (istradefylline) was synthesised as previously described(Hockemeyer et al., 2004) and was diluted in the drinking water aspreviously in our lab (Mouro et al., 2017). The dose (approx. 3 mg/kg/day, 0,025% methylcellulose) was selected according to previous studies(Yang et al., 2007; Mouro et al., 2017). Water consumption per dayper animal was 7\u20138 mL. The change in body weight throughout the KW-6002 administration period did not exceed 20% (2\u20134 g from a bodyweight of about 20 g, Figure Supplementary Fig. 2), for most animalsbeing about 10%. Thus, the concentration of KW-6002 in the drinkingwater (7.5 \u03bcg/mL, corresponding to 19.5 \u03bcM) was kept constantthroughout the period of drug administration. No marked differences inwater consumption were detected while comparing KW-6002 treatedmice with control mice.KW-6002 administration started when animals were 11 weeks old(before overt onset of motor symptoms) and lasted until 16\u201318 weeks ofage, when animals had to be euthanized due to hind limb paralysis. Exvivo electrophysiological experiments and tissue storage for molecularanalysis were performed in the day of euthanasia. The reason forstarting treatment when mice were 11 weeks old was to allow treatmentonset to be as close as possible to the early symptomatic disease stage,without shortening the treatment too much. At 11 weeks of ageSOD1G93A mice were not yet clearly symptomatic, regarding hind limbparesis, though some subtle alterations should already be present. In aprevious paper (Rocha et al., 2013) we detected alterations on themotor profile (assessed by the Rota Rod test) of 12\u201315 weeks oldSOD1G93A mice. In this paper we decided not to assess motor function ofanimals that could be close to the symptomatic stage to avoid confoundingeffects resulting from exercise.Since KW-6002 is photosensitive, the solution was prepared in adark chamber and placed into bottles with light protection. The controlgroup received a vehicle solution, containing 0.025% methylcellulosediluted in drinking water. No substantial differences between the twogroups (KW-6002 and control) were detected in terms of water intake(approximately 7\u20138 mL per day per mouse).",

In brief, discrete areas of lateral motoneuron columns were finely dissected from the lumbar part of the spinal cords of 15-day-old (E15d) Wistar rat embryos. The dissected tissues were incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 20 min with 1 mL of 15 U/mL papain (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ, USA) supplemented with cysteine (1 mM) in HBSS. After treatment with papain, the tissue was rinsed and dissociated in HBSS\u20130.2% BSA by gentle trituration. The trituration step was repeated and the resultant cell suspension (5 mL) was layered onto 4 mL cold 6.5% iopamiron in HBSS in a 15 mL siliconized conical glass tube. After centrifugation at 400 \u00d7 g for 15 min at 4 \u25e6C, the intermediate layer (500  L) was collected and transferred into another tube containing 2.5 mL cold culture medium. After centrifugation at 100 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u25e6C, cells were resuspended in fresh culture medium and plated in Greiner 4-well culture dishes (10 mm i.d.; Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) at a density of 1000\u20132000 cells per well.

The purity of motoneurons, as shown in our previous paper, was more than 80% [19]. Dishes were precoated with 0.5 mg/mL poly-l-ornithin in 0.15 M borate buffer (pH 8.5) at 4 \u25e6C overnight, and subsequently incubated with 10  g/mL laminin in serum-free cultured medium in a 5% CO2 incubator. The standard culture medium consisted of 75 mL Leibovitz\u2019s L-15 \\medium supplemented with glucose (4 g/L), 15 mL of 0.15 M sodium bicarbonate, 5 mL heat-inactivated horse serum, and 100 units/mL penicillin G, and was neutralized with CO2.",

This test was performed 3 times a week from day 70 onwards. Survival was defined as the age in days when mice could no longer ride themselves when gently prodded for approximately 10 s and/or the appearance of severe eye infection.Disease duration was defined as the time between disease onset and survival.The rotarod performance test was done using a Rotarod (ColumbusInstruments, Columbus, OH), which has a rotating rod starting with a speed 20 rpm and accelerated 1 rpm every 10 s. The rotarod performance test measured the time it took for each mouse to fall off the rotarod. The rotarod test was used to obtain two endpoints:rotarod onset defined as the age in days after which the mouse fell consistently below 80% of average performance and rotarod survival as the age in days after which the mouse fell consistently below 20% of average performance.",

The animals were killed at 199 days of age. Low copy number G93A SOD1 mice develop signs of disease at 6\u20137 months and die 4\u20136 weeks later. We therefore selected 199 days as an age when many animals would be expected to show signs of disease, yet none to have died. Since survival was predefined and not an experimental end point, we developed a six-point clinical scale to gauge the severity of disease at the age of killing. In this scale, a score of 0 was given to mice showing no evidence of disease, 1 to those showing first evidence of disease (as above), 2 showing first evidence of paresis in the hind limbs, and then progressively until 6 with complete paralysis of the hind limbs. The scale proved simple to use in practice, and all scoring was undertaken by a single examiner. At the age of killing, all animals were still able to access cage floor-level food and water, and able to right themselves within 30 s after being placed on their side, which we and others have accepted previously as reasons for killing. Since estrogen was expected to provide neuroprotective effects (Xu et al., 1996), we also investigated the effects of gender on the onset and severity of clinical signs in male and female mice, irrespective of treatment. All animals were killed with carbon dioxide at 199 days of age and parts of the CNS (cerebral hemisphere and spinal cord: T2 to L1 section) and certain skeletal muscles (extensor digitorum longus [EDL] and medial gastrocnemius) were immediately excised and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical analysis. Lumbar portions of the spinal cord (L2\u2013sacral region) were immersed and fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for subsequent histopathological analysis (Paraffin embedded). Lumbar regions were sectioned (3  m) on a microtome and stained with Cresyl Violet. The L3 region was chosen for neuron counting to ensure clean sections distal to the cut at L2 for removal of the cord segment. Magnified digital images ( 200) were obtained for each section. The total number of neurons in each ventral horn, as well as the number of medium- (15\u201325  m) and large-diameter ( 25  m) neurons were determined on two separate occasions using ImagePro software. We also calculated the mean number of neurons per unit of anterior horn area. All cells that were within the ventral horn anterior to a line across the spinal cord touching the anterior part of the central canal were counted and the mean of the right and left side was reported. These data were all analyzed by the same experimenter blinded to the treatments. The average test\u2013retest coefficient of variation for counting the total number of neurons in the spinal cord sections across all of the data in the experiment was 16.5%.",

For the experiments performed in the SMND7 mouse model of SMA,animals were divided into four groups: SMND7 and WTtreated with different doses of LiCl (taken from 8 Mstock solution, Sigma), and the SMND7 and WT treated with the corresponding volume of physiological salinesolution (vehicle). Mice were subcutaneously injected once a day from P1 until either P12 or their death. Atselected times, mice were killed by decapitation, theblood was quickly removed and centrifuged at 3000 rpmfor 15 min, and the serum collected and frozen. Tissuesamples were rapidly dissected and removed, and subsequently processed as indicated below. Organs such as thymus, spleen, kidney, liver and heart were also dissected and weighted. Li concentration in mouse plasma was determined by means of atomic absorption spectrophotometry and expressed in mEq/L.

For the tube test, each mouse was placed head down, hanging by its hind limbs in a 50-ml plastic centrifuge tube containing a cotton ball at the bottom to protect the animal fall. Two parameters were evaluated for the tube test: the latency (in seconds) to fall from the edge of the tube, and the positioning of the legs and tail. In the latter, the posture adopted by the mouse was scored according to the following criteria:score 4, normal separation of hind limbs with tail raised;score 3, weakness is perceptible and hind limbs are closer together but they seldom touch each other; score2, hind limbs are close to each other and often touching;score 1, weakness is apparent and hind limbs arealmost always in a clasp position with the tail raised;score 0, constant clasping of the hind with the tail lowered; a score of 1 was given in the case the micefailed to hold onto the tube.

At 60 days of age, littermate and bodyweight-matched mice were divided into trehalose treatment and control groups. Prior to treatment, the between-group variability was minimized by organizing the mice according to the following criteria: (1) age-, littermate-and weight-matched mice were evenly distributedin the trehalose-treated and control groups; and (2) each mouse in the trehalose-treated group had a corresponding littermate sister in the control group. Mean starting weights were typically within 0.3 g between groups.In the trehalose group, mice were treated daily with2% (w/v) trehalose (Sinozyme Biotechnology Co, Ltd,Nanning, China) via spontaneous oral administration(Tanaka et al., 2004; Davies et al., 2006). Trehalose was dissolved in the drinking water and the water solution was changed twice per week. In the control group, mice were given untreated drinking water.A preliminary experiment was conducted to determine the early effects of trehalose in transgenic SOD1-G93Aand non-transgenic mice. Twenty transgenic mice (10control and 10 trehalose-treated) and 20 non-transgenic mice (10 control and 10 trehalose-treated) were separated at 60 days of age and treated as described above. The mice were sacrificed at 90 days of age and their tissues were subjected to Western blot analysis (fivemice per group) or immuno histochemical analyses (fivemice per group) as described below.After the early-stage experiment, a survival/endstage experiment was conducted to determine the endstage effects of trehalose in transgenic SOD1-G93A and non-transgenic. Thirty female SOD1-G93Atransgenic mice (15 control and 15 trehalose-treated)and 20 female non-transgenic littermates (10 controland 10 trehalose-treated) were used. Mice were separated at 60 days of age into trehalose treatment or control groups and treated as described above. For the survival study, we assessed disease progression using a neurological score (see the Neurological ScoreAssessment section for details). If one hind leg wasgiven a score of 2, food pellets were left on the bedding. If both hind legs were given a score of 2,smashed food was provided in addition to food pellets on the bedding and a long sipper tube was placed onthe water bottle to ensure sufficient trehalose and water intake.All mice in the survival experiment were monitored from 60 days of age until death (neurological score of4), and their tissues were subjected to Western blot analysis (five mice per group) or immunohistochemicalanalyses (five mice per group) as described below.",

All transgenic mice in the survival/end-stage experiment were assessed three times per week starting at 60 days of age and given neurological scores by an investigator who was blind to the treatment. The neurological scorescale was 0\u20134, as developed by ALSTDI (ALS TherapyDevelopment Institute) (Scott et al., 2008; Gill et al.,2009; Lincecum et al., 2010). The criteria used to assign each score were as follows: (0) full extension of the hindlegs away from the lateral midline when the mouse is suspended by its tail, the mouse can hold this position for two seconds at a time when suspended two to three times; (1)collapse or partial collapse of leg extension toward the lateral midline (weakness) or trembling of the hind legs during tail suspension; (2) toes curl under at least twice during a 12-inch walk, or any part of the foot is dragged along the cage bottom/table; (3) rigid paralysis or minimaljoint movement, the foot is not being used for forward motion; and (4) the mouse cannot right itself within 30 s,from either side.Disease onset was defined as the date when the mouse was first assessed with a neurological score of1. Once a score of 3 was reached, the mouse was tested twice daily until death to ensure that the date of death was accurately determined. For humane reasons,all mice were immediately euthanized by cervical dislocation once they reached a neurological score of 4.Thus, for the purposes of this study, death was definedas the mouse reaching a neurological score of 4 duringthe survival experiment. The date and cause of deathwere recorded for each mouse. End stage was also defined by the date when the mouse reached a neurological score of 4.",

In the hanging wire test, the mice were placed on a wired housing cage lid. The lid was gently shaken to prompt the mouse to grasp the wire grid, and then the lid was swiftly inverted. The time from lid inversion until the mouse released the lid with both hind limbs was measured.Each mouse was given up to three attempts to holdon to the inverted lid for an arbitrary maximum of 90 s, andthe longest time that was achieved was recorded for eachmouse (Weydt et al., 2003).",

Five mice from each group were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde fixative in 0.1 M phosphatebuffer (pH 7.4) under deep anesthesia (10% chloralhydrate, 0.2 ml/mouse, intraperitoneally) at 90 days ofage or at the end stage in the preliminary and survivalexperiments, respectively. Spinal cords were dissected and the lumbar segments (L 3\u20135) were post-fixed in the same fixative solution at 4  C for 24 h. The fixed lumbar segments were then cut into 20-lm sections using aVibratome Microtome (Leica VT 1000S, LeicaBiosystems, Nussloch, Germany). The sections were washed three times in PBS and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. After blocking with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min and 10% horse serum for 1 h at room temperature, antibodies against neuron-specificnuclear protein (NeuN; 1:500, Millipore, Bedford, MA,USA) were applied to some tissue sections overnight at4  C. The sections were subsequently incubated withbiotinylated anti-mouse IgG (1:200, ZSGB-BIO, Beijing,China) for 2 h at room temperature, followed byincubation with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:200,ZSGB-BIO, China) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally,sections were treated with 0.03% diaminobenzidine as achromogen for 10 min. The sections were visualized and photographed with an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a DP72 digital camera system (Olympus,Tokyo, Japan).To assess whether trehalose treatment exerted an effect on glial activation in the spinal cord of ALS mice,we used a rabbit anti-Iba1 antibody (1:500, Wako,Richmond, VA, USA), a marker for activated microglia,and a mouse anti-GFAP monoclonal IgG antibody(1:200, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), a specific markerfor astrocytes. Microglial and astrocytic activation was assessed in the spinal cords of trehalose-treated or untreated transgenic mice at 90 days and at end stageof the disease. Immunoreactivity was visualized by incubating sections for 1 h at room temperature withfluorescent secondary antibodies (FITC conjugate ofgoat anti-rabbit or Cy5 conjugate of goat anti-mouseIgG, 1:500, ZSGB-BIO). Negative controls wereperformed by incubating sections with primary orsecondary antibodies only. All sections were examinedusing a confocal laser scanning biological microscope(FV1000, Olympus).",

Stride length was defined as the distance between prints made by hind limbs and taken from the toe of one print to the toe of next one. The test was performed until at least four clear continuous steps of bothright and left hindlimbs could be obtained, and each length ofthree strides of both hindlimbs was measured.",

Under these staining conditions (5-minute incubation),Hoechst 33258 does not stain microglial nuclei, which usually require at least 20 min of incubation, while CGNs nuclei are stained. Occasionally stained glial nuclei can be excluded from counting because they are oval (CGNs nuclei are round) and considerably larger[47].",

The SOD1G37R mice were housed at the standard temperature (21\u00b0C) and in light controlled environment with ad libitum access to the food and water. The study was carried out using groups of transgenic littermates derived from the breeding of heterozygous SOD1G37R mice. The mouse littermates were fed a regular rodent food (Harlan, Teklad) and were randomly divided into minocycline-treated and control groups, including wild type littermates. To avoid any potential interference with the minocycline antibacterial effects, mice were kept in pathogen free facility. At the age of 7 or 9 months, SOD1G37R mice from the experimental groups were administered minocycline in the diet. Minocycline (Sigma, Canada) was delivered in the special Custom Made Rodent Diet (Harlan, Teklad) at a concentration of 1 g/kg. For the control groups the regular diet was continued until the mice reached end-stage disease. When progression of muscle weakness became marked, mice were fed at the bottom of their cages together with specially designed containers allowing them permanent access to water. Onset of the clinical disease was determined by measurement of motor strength test, as described below (Kong et al., 1998) and by the hind limb contraction when mice were suspended by their tail. At the end-stage disease, the mice were monitored daily. They were killed when they started to lie on the side in their cages and when they start to express difficulties in grooming, as described previously (Gurney et al., 1996). To confirm the effects of minocycline, two independent experiments were carried out at six-month interval with different sets of trangenic SOD1G37R mice. Similar results were obtained in both cases.",

G93A mice aged 90 (5 control, 5 creatine) and 120 days(10 control, 10 creatine) and WT mice aged 120 days (10control, 10 creatine) were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal infusion of pentobarbitone sodium (50 mg/(kg bodyweight)). From one hindlimb, m. soleus and m. extens or digitorum longus (EDL) were carefully dissected and incubated for 15 min in organ baths containing Krebs-Henseleitsolution (118 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM KCL,1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM KH2PO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 1 mMglucose) which was continuously gassed with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and maintained at 25\u00b0C. Thereafter,these muscles (not subjected to contractions) were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at  80\u00b0C for later biochemical assays. Soleus and EDL muscles from the contralateral hindlimb were dissected and wires were attached to the tendons and mounted vertically in an incubation bath with one tendon attached to a force transducer and stimulated with capacitor discharges of alternating polarity.After mounting, a 15-min stabilization period was allowedand optimal muscle length (L0) was determined. In order to evaluate twitch and tetanic characteristics, soleus and EDL muscles were electrically stimulated 5 times at 1 Hz, interspersed with 1-min rest intervals (twitch stimulation), and three times for 700 ms at 100 Hz (EDL) and 500 ms at 50Hz(Sol) with 4-min rest intervals (tetanic stimulation). The average maximal specific tension (  force corrected forcross-sectional area), Max dF/dt (maximal rate of forcedevelopment) and Min dF/dt (maximal rate of relaxation)were calculated for the twitch and tetanic contractions.Cross-sectional area was determined by dividing the wet muscle mass by the product of muscle length (L0) and 1.06g/cm3, the density of mammalian skeletal muscle. The fatigability was evaluated as the decrease in tetanic tension during six consecutive 2-min bouts of repeated tetani (350ms) with decreasing rest-intervals (3.8, 3.1, 2.6, 2.1, 1.6,and 1.3 s). Recovery was evaluated by a single tetanus delivered 5 and 10 min into recovery following cessation ofthe fatigue protocol.",

In brief: ventral spinal cords were dissected from 14-day-oldWistar rat embryo\u2019s in Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution (HBSS), cut in 1 mm pieces and treated with trypsin and DNase before dispersion into single cells by trituration. A motor neuron-enriched cell population was purified by centrifugation of these single cells on a 6.2% OptiPrep\u2122 (Axis-shield Poc AS, Oslo, Norway) cushion and cultured on a spinal glial feeder layer. For cell death experiments, this glial feeder layer was pre established on 35 mm poly-L-ornitine/laminin-coated culture dishes (Nunclon, Roskilde, Denmark), for voltage-clamp experiments on 15 mm round poly-L-ornitine/laminin-coated glass coverslips. The neuronal culture medium consisted of L15 supplemented with glucose (3.6 mg/ml), sodium bicarbonate (0.2%), progesterone (20 nM), insulin (5 \u03bcg/ml), putrescine (0.1 mM), conalbumine (0.1 mg/ml), sodium selenite (30 nM), antibiotics (penicillin: 100 IU/ml and streptomycin: 100 \u03bcg/ml), 2% horse serum and 5% chicken embryo extract. All media and additives were from Gibco, BRL (Grand Island, NY). Cultures were kept in a 7% CO2 humidified incubator and used after at least 1 week in culture, during which period they differentiated as judged by neuronal morphology and more than 80% of the cultured neurons stained positive for motor neuron markers like peripherin and SMI-32 (Van Damme et al., 2002b; Van Den Bosch et al., 2000; Vandenberghe et al., 1998).",

In the first paradigm, motor neurons were exposed to300 \u03bcM kainate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.1\u20135 mM ATP(Sigma) or control at 37\u00b0C in a modified Krebs solution (122.3 mMNaCl, 5.9 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 11.6 mMHEPES, 11.5 mM glucose, pH 7.3) in the presence of 10 \u03bcM MK-801 (an NMDA-receptor antagonist; Tocris Cookson, Bristol, UK).After 30 min, the Krebs-solution was removed and replaced by culture medium. In the second test model, hypoxia was induced by maintaining the cultures in an incubator containing 0.5% O2.Hypoglycemia was obtained by omitting glucose from the culture medium. After 4 h at 0.5% O2, the medium without glucose was replaced by normal medium and the cultures were placed in a normal incubator. The medium of control cultures was replaced at the same time points, but normal culture medium was used and they were keptunder normal conditions.When cultures were preincubated, substances were added to the culture medium before the exposure to kainate or hypoxia/hypoglycemia and also during the exposure. Ivermectin (TopSmartInc., BH, CA, USA; stock solution 10m Min DMSO) or DMSO was added 1/104 to the cultures. Cibacron Blue 3G-A (CB; Sigma),PPADS (Sigma) and ATP were dissolved in HBSS and added 1/103.In general, pre incubation time was 8 h except when mentioned otherwise or when ATP was added. Because of the instability of extracellular ATP (t1/2 is 30 to 40 min, Lazarowski et al., 2000), ATP was added three times to the culture medium, 4 h, 2 h and 1 h before the exposure.The survival of motor neurons was quantified by counting the min a marked area under phase contrast before preincubation, before the exposure and 24 h after the exposure, with the observer blinded to the treatment conditions. Survival after exposure was expressed as the ratio of the number of motor neurons present 24 h after the exposure to the number immediately before exposure and normalized to the survival of control treated cultures.",

Pipettes were back-filled with pipette solution containing50\u201375 \u03bcg/ml gramicidin, after tip-filling with gramicidin-freesolution. Gramicidin was freshly dissolved in DMSO (50 \u03bcg/\u03bcl)for each experiment. Pipettes had a resistance of 2\u20134M\u03a9when filled with intracellular solution. After seal formation, the progress of perforation was followed by evaluating the decrease in series resistance. Cells were accepted for study if series resistance (Rs)dropped below 30 M\u03a9 and remained stable during the experiment.Cells were held at a membrane potential of \u221260 mV and I\u2013Vrelationships were generated using voltage ramps from \u2212100 mV to+50 mV. AMPA receptor currents were elicited by 100 \u03bcM kainate.Signals were recorded using a L/M-EPC7 List-Medical amplifier,filtered at 3 kHz, sampled at 2 kHz and analyzed offline (Digidata1200, pClamp8, Axon Instruments). The normal pipette solution consisted of 125 mM CsCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mMNa2ATP and 1 mM EGTA, pH adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH.

TEACl was added tothis solution to avoid kainate-induced inhibition of voltage-gated K+channels. The Na+-rich extracellular solution contained 105 mMNaCl, 30 mM TEACl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2,5 mM HEPES, 15.8 mM glucose, pH adjusted to 7.3 with NaOH.The Ca2+-rich extracellular solution consisted of 30 mM CaCl2,30 mM TEACl, 75 mM N-methyl-D-glucamine, 5 mM HEPES,5 mM glucose, pH adjusted to 7.3 with HCl. All experiments were carried out in the presence of 500 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX;Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), 10 \u03bcM MK-801 and 100 \u03bcM Cd2+to block voltage-gated Na+ channels, NMDA receptors and voltageoperatedCa2+ channels, respectively. The Ca2+ permeability ratios,PCa/PNa were determined from the reversal potentials obtained inthe Na+-rich (VrevNa) and the Ca2+-rich solution (VrevCa) according to the equation (Geiger et al., 1995): PCa/PNa=0.25 aNa/aCa {exp[(2VrevCa\u2212VrevNa)F/RT]+exp[(VrevCa\u2212VrevNa)F/RT]}, where aNa and aCa are the ion activities of Na+ and Ca2+ in the extracellularsolution and F, R and T have their conventional meaning. Activity coefficients were estimated by interpolation of tabulated values(0.75 for NaCl, 0.55 for CaCl2). To estimate the total number of AMPA receptors present on motor neurons, AMPA receptor current densities were calculated by dividing the AMPA receptor current amplitude at \u221260 mV by the membrane capacitance.\n\nEffect of ivermectin on the electrophysiological properties of the AMPA receptor",

SOD1 G93A (B6SJL-TgN[SOD1-G93A]1Gur) mice were weekly monitored for weight, and starting at 80 days of age,they were assessed for motor dysfunction by measuring hind limb muscle strength using a Grip Strength Meter (Columbus Instruments,OH). Grip strength testing was performed by allowing the animals to grasp a platform followed by pulling the animal until it released the platform; the force measurement was recorded in three separate trials, and the average was used in analyses.Onset of disease symptoms was determined as a reduction inmuscle strength performance between weekly time points. Starting at around 100 days of age, G93A SOD1 mice were observed daily. Aqua-Jel packs were put in the mouse cages when theystarted to show disease symptoms to keep them nourished and hydrated.Motor performance in the SOD1 G93A (B6.Cg-Tg[SOD1-G93A]1Gur/J) was monitored by Rotorod testing using a Rotamex Rota-rod (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). For this purpose the mice are placed on a partitioned rotating rod andtested at a series of increasing speeds, recording the time that the animal remains on the rod at each speed, the overall rod performance (ORP) of each animal is then calculated as the area under the curve in a plot of time-on-the rod against rotation speed.Rotarod determinations were not performed on mice treated withregimens used in excess of 75 \u03bcg TV-5010. The rotarod tests were administered weekly, allowing mice to rest at least 6 days following injections before testing. Mice were pre-conditioned for 60 s in 20 s intervals at increasing speeds of 5, 10, 15, 20, and25 rpm for each mouse. Finally, for the measurement of the ORP,mice were assessed at 3 speeds (5, 10, and 15 rpm) for a total of180 s maximum or until the mouse failed to remain on the rod.Motor performance of SOD1 G37R mutants was analyzed using rotarod device (Columbus Instruments, OH). The rotarod tests were carried out once a week starting at 39 weeks of age for the mice in which treatment was initiated at 6 months of age and at 45 weeks of age for the mice that were treated starting at 9 monthsof age. Each mouse was placed on accelerating rod within the cutoff time of 180 s. Mice were scored by the remaining time of eachtrial, obtained from maximum score from three trials. When progression of muscle weakness became marked, mice were fed atthe bottom of their cages together with especially designed containers allowing them permanent access to water. Onset ofthe clinical disease was determined by the hind limb contractionwhen mice were suspended by their tail. At the end-stage disease,the mice were monitored daily.To determine mortality in a reliable and ethical fashion, asimilar artificial end point was used for all SOD1 mutant mice,defined by the inability of mice to right themselves within 30 s when placed on their sides. The moribund mice were scored as \u201cdead\u201d and were euthanized.",

Cells were plated in p60 dishes during 5 daysand treated during 72 h with different doses of masitinib(0.5\u20131 \u03bcM) in DMEM-10 % FBS. An estimated 200,000 cells were processed for each mRNA extraction using RNeasy Micro kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. mRNA yields were measured on Nanodrop device (Thermo Scientific) and cDNA were obtained from 0.5 \u03bcg of RNA (\u221280 \u00b0C), 4 \u03bcL of iScriptreverse transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (BIORAD,\u221220 \u00b0C) in a final volume of 20 \u03bcL filled with nuclease free water. The Thermo cycler was set as follows: priming 5 min at 25 \u00b0C followed by 30 min at 42 \u00b0C for reverse transcription and 5\u2032 at 85 \u00b0C for RT inactivation.RT-qPCR was performed on reverse transcribed cDNA using SsoAdvanced\u2122 Universal SYBR\u00ae Green Supermix(BIO-RAD) on a CFX96 Touch\u2122 real-time PCR detection system. For each well, 5 \u03bcL of diluted DNA was added to 20 \u03bcL of mix (containing 1 \u03bcL of each primer,12.5 \u03bcL of SsoAdvanced\u2122 Universal SYBR\u00ae Green Supermix,5.5 \u03bcL of nuclease free water). Each sample was run in duplicate. The cycling parameters were as follows:30 s at 95 \u00b0C then 40 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 10 and 30 s at60 \u00b0C. Cq values were obtained for every cycle. Primers were designed on NCBI Primer-BLAST following the best guidelines to exclude genomic DNA amplification.The analysis was done using BioRad CFX manager 3.1 with a threshold set at 650 RFU corresponding to the amplification curves linear portion. Variations between samples were normalized using two house keeping genes PGK1 and HPRT. All primers were validated for specificity and efficiency. Primers were designed on PrimerBlast.All primers were validated with differentiated bone marrow-derived rat macrophages (BMDM) in vitro and selected for specificity and quantitativity before being tested on primary microglia from SOD1G93A rats(only primers achieving quantitatively up to a dilution factor of 500 were kept).

We evaluated the onset of neuromuscular symptoms at the age when the mouse exhibits the first failure in the pawgrip strength test at two consecutive time points. The age at which the mice were no longer able to perform the grip strength test was considered as time of paralysis.The mice were euthanized by deep anesthesia when they were unable to right themselves within 10 s after being placed on either side.

        "text": "Treatments. As the majority of patients with ALS are sporadic, and treatment can only be started at the time of diagnosis, mSOD1G93A mice were treated starting from the onset of motor symptoms (i.e., from around 16\u201317 weeks of age) until the end stage of disease. Fingolimod (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was administered intraperitoneally 3 times weekly at doses (0.1 or 1 mg/kg) that have been shown to be protective in other animal models of neurodegeneration [24, 25]. We enrolled the following animals per experimental group: WT vehicle = 5 female and 5 male; mSOD1 vehicle = 8 females and 11 males; mSOD1 fingolimod 0.1 = 6 females and 6 males; mSOD1 fingolimod 1 = 5 females and 4 males. Drug- and vehicle-treated animals were monitored for survival (primary endpoint). Body weight, motor function, and neurological score were considered as secondary endpoints. The expression of genes related to neuroinflammation was analyzed in motor cortex and spinal cords of end-stage mice. To get insight into the time course of the effects of fingolimod, another group of mSOD1G93A mice (n = 4/group balanced for sex) was treated from the onset of symptoms with the lower dose of fingolimod (0.1 mg/kg) and tissues were collected after 2 weeks of fingolimod administration for molecular analysis. The experimental groups were sex balanced; a group of vehicle-treated WT mice (n = 8) were also analyzed for internal control. These animals were subjected to all behavioral tests used in preclinical trials in order to obtain experimental groups comparable for stress, manipulation, and physical exercise.",

Urea lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 \u00d7g for 20 minat 4 \u00b0C and the supernatants collected as insoluble fraction.Fifteen micrograms of proteins was loaded and resolved in12% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE gel and transferred on PVDFmembranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). After transfer,membranes were stained by Ponceau (Sigma) for total transferred proteinevaluation. Western blot was performed by blocking in 3%BSA (bovine serum albumin, Biobasic Canada) prepared inTBS-tween 1% (VWR Lifescience). Proteins of interest weredetected by incubating the membrane overnight in blocking buffer with primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-hTDP-43(1:1000, Abnova) and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP (1:5000, glialfibrillary acidic protein, DAKO). Finally, membranes were incubated with respective horse radish peroxidase secondary antibodies 1:5000 in blocking buffer, and chemiluminescence was revealed by ECL reagent (electrogenerated chemiluminescence,Thermo Fisher Scientific) on light films (Kodak).Immunoreactivity was quantified by Image Lab software(Biorad) and normalized on Ponceau signals.",

Then, cell respiration was evaluated using the Oxygraph 2 K respirometer (Oroboros InstrumentsCorp). Oxygen consumption was recorded at 37 \u00b0C in non permeabilized intact cells. The rate of oxygen consumption(OCR or O2 flux) was calculated by the equipment software(DataLab) and was expressed as picomoles of oxygenper milliliter per second.During recording, basal oxygen consumption (basalOCR) stabilization was followed by sequential additionof 1) the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin (oligo,2 \u03bcg/ml), to obtain ATP production related-OCR, 2) successive steps of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide ptrifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone(FCCP, 0.5 \u03bcM each)until maximal respiratory capacity OCR levels was reached, and 3) the mitochondrial complex III inhibitorantimycin A (AA, 2.5 \u03bcM) to obtain the nonmitochondrial OCR. AA-inhibited OCR was subtracted from other values to obtain the mitochondrial oligo-inhibited OCR related to ATP synthesis (oligo-inhibited flux\u2013AA-inhibited flux)and the maximal mitochondrial respiratory capacity OCR(maximum FCCP-uncoupled flux\u2013AA-inhibited flux,MRR). Spare respiratory capacity (SRC) was obtained by subtracting basal OCR from MRR. Mitochondrial function was then expressed as the respiratory control ratio (RCR)index of the intact cells, calculated as the ratio: mitochondrial oligo-inhibited OCR/maximal mitochondrial respiratorycapacity OCR. The cell RCR index has the same 2main advantages as coupling efficiency, which are sensitivity to several potential sites of dysfunction and internal normalization. It is a good marker of mitochondrial dysfunctionin cells, as it depends on almost every functional aspect of OXPHOS [26, 27]. Graphical explanation of calculated parameters is shown in the BResults^ section(Fig. 2a).",

Female rats were used for the experiment.All rats were weighed, and motor activity was observedtwice/week from 90 to 100 days of age. Disease onset was determined for each animal when pronounced muscleatrophy was accompanied by abnormal gait, typically expressed as subtle limping or dragging of 1 hind limb.In this moment, animals were randomly assigned to controlor DCA treatment group (n = 5 per group). Body weight was 286 \u00b1 7.8 in control and 279 \u00b1 10.8 g in DCA group atthe start of treatment (t8 = 0.538; p = 0.606), and there were no differences after 10 days (276 \u00b1 3.6 in control and 274\u00b1 11.0 g in DCA group; t8 = 0.128; p = 0.902).

A buffer containing 180 mM KCl, 5 mM MOPS, 2 mM EDTA, 1 m Mdiethylenetriaminepenta acetic acid, and 1 \u03bcM of freshly prepared butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) at pH 7.3 wasused, employing a 1:20 (sample weight:homogenization buffervolume ratio). A homogenizer device (T10 basicUltraTurraX, IKA, Staufen, Germany) was employed for mechanicalhomogenization (15 s at 15,000 rpm). Protein concentrationswere measured by the Bradford method [21].After the homogenization, lipids from the sample were extractedwith chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) 0.01% BHT for 3times as described in [22]. The chloroform phase was evaporatedunder N2. Then, the fatty acids were transesterified byincubation of lipids in freshly prepared 5% methanolic HClfor 90 min at 75 \u00b0C. The extraction of the resulting fatty acidmethyl esters was performed by adding n-pentane and saturatedNaCl solution (2:1 v/v). The n-pentane phase was removedunder nitrogen. The remaining product was dissolved in 80 \u03bclof CS2 for gas chromatography. Separation was assessed by aDBWAX capillary column (30 m\u00d7 0.25 mm\u00d7 0.20 \u03bcm) in anAgilent GC System 7890Awith a Series Injector 7683B and aflame ionization detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,CA). The injection port was maintained at 220 \u00b0C and thedetector at 250 \u00b0C. The temperature program was as follows:2 min at 100 \u00b0C, then an increase of 10 \u00b0C/min to 200 \u00b0C, then5 \u00b0C/min to 240 \u00b0C, and finally maintained at 240 \u00b0C for10 min. For fatty acid methyl ester integration, we comparedthe peaks with the retention time of authentic standards(Larodan Fine Chemicals, Malm\u00f6, Sweden) injected according to the same method. Results were expressed as mol%.The fatty acid\u2013derived indexes [22] were calculated withthe following formulas: Saturated fatty acids (SFA) = \u03a3 % of saturated fatty acids; unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) = \u03a3 % unsaturated fatty acids; monounsaturated fatty acids(MUFA) = \u03a3 % of monoenoic fatty acids; polyunsaturated fatty acids series n-3 (PUFAn-3) = \u03a3 % of polyunsaturatedfatty acids n-3 series; polyunsaturated fatty acids series n-6(PUFAn-6) = \u03a3 % of polyunsaturated fatty acids n-6 series;average chain length (ACL) = [(\u03a3 % total 14 \u00d7 14) + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + (\u03a3% total n \u00d7 n)]/100 (n = carbon atom number ) ;peroxidizability index (PI) = [(\u03a3 mol% monoenoic \u00d70.025) + (\u03a3 mol% dienoic \u00d7 1) + (\u03a3 mol% trienoic \u00d7 2) + (\u03a3mol% tetraenoic \u00d7 4) + (\u03a3 mol% pentaenoic \u00d7 6) + (\u03a3 mol%hexaenoic \u00d7 8)]; double-bond index (DBI) = [(\u03a3 mol%monoenoic) + (2 \u00d7 \u03a3 mol% dienoic) + (3 \u00d7 \u03a3 mol%trienoic) + (4 \u00d7 \u03a3 % mol tetraenoic) + (5 \u00d7 \u03a3 mol%pentaenoic) + (6 \u00d7 \u03a3 mol% hexaenoic); anti-inflammatory index(AI) = (20:3n-6) + (20:5n-3) + (22:5n-3) + (22:6n-3)/(20:4n-6). This index accounts for potential changes in cellmembrane phospholipids (altering the substrate of cyclooxygenases from arachidonic acid to EPA/DHA), providingeicosanoids and other derivates that have lower inflammatorypotential, as specific prostaglandins (PGE3) and otherproducts [23].",

Mice were then perfused with saline solution followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich,St. Louis, MO, USA) solution (freshly prepared with pH 7.4phosphate buffer). Spinal cords were extracted and fixationwas continued by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde madein pH 7.4 phosphate buffer overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The next day,samples were cryopreserved in 30% sucrose (made in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer) for 48 h. After this time, tissue was encasedin a cubic recipient (Peel-A-Way Disposable EmbeddingMolds-S-22, Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA), and embeddedin tissue-freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical SciencesInc., Newcastle, UK) and frozen (\u2212 80 \u00b0C). The lumbar spinalcord was then cut at a 16-\u03bcm section depth and resulting seeded on a gelatin-coated slide. In the case of organotypicslices, these were directly seeded onto the slides. Sampleswere permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 PBS for 30 minand blocked with 5% normal horse serum in 0.4% Triton X-100 PBS (blocking solution) for 2 h at room temperature.Primary antibody (diluted according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions)incubation, anti-8-oxo-dG (ab62623, Abcam,Cambridge, UK), anti-\u03b3H2Ax (ab2893, Abcam), anti-GFAP(ab7260, Abcam) anti-Iba1 (ab5076, Abcam), and anti-SMI-32 (Covance, Princeton, NJ), was performed in blocking solutionovernight at 4 \u00b0C.

In selected sections, the primary antibody was omitted to assure labeling specificity.Confocal microscopy was performed with a Fluoview 1000microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) for immunofluorescenceimaging. Immunoreactivity quantification andmotor neuron count (in the case of organotypic culture) wereanalyzed with the ImageJ software [25], by selecting motorregion from anterior horns in the spinal cord. Motor neuronswere putatively identified by soma size, low DAPI fluorescence,and anterior location. All measurements and analyseswere done in a double-blinded fashion.\n\nRepresentative confocal images (left) and quantitative analyses (right) of DNA repair mechanisms (\u03b3H2Ax) and DHA-related decreases in DNA oxidative damage (8-oxo-dG) in whole LSC sections of 90-dayold G93A male mice, measured in immunohistochemistry.",

At 16 weeks of age 4\u20135 mice of each group were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS andthe lumbar segment of the spinal cord was harvested,post-fixed for 24 h, and cryopreserved in 30% sucrose.Transverse 40 \u03bcm thick sections were serially cut with acryotome (Leica) between L2-L5 segmental levels. Foreach segment, each section of a series of 10 was collected sequentially on separate gelatin-coated slides orfree-floating in Olmos medium.One slide of each animal was rehydrated for 1 minand stained for 2 h with an acidified solution of 3.1 mMcresyl violet. Then, the slides were washed in distilledwater for 1 min, dehydrated and mounted with DPX(Fluka). MNs counts were made for neuronal somapresent in the lateral part of lamina IX of the ventral hornin the spinal cord sections and following strict size andmorphological criteria: only MNs with diameters largerthan 20 \u03bcm, polygonal shape and prominent nucleoli werecounted. The number of MNs present in both ventralhorns was counted in four serial sections of each L4 andL5 segments [36,40], where motor nuclei innervating TA and plantar muscles are located [41].Another series of sections was blocked with PBS-Triton-FBS and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with rabbit primaryantibody against ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule1 (Iba1, 1:1000, Wako). After several washes, sections wereincubated for 1 hour at room temperature with Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200; Life Science). Forco-localizations, spinal MNs were labeled with 500/525-Neurotrace fluorescent Nissl staining (1:200, Life Science).To quantify microglial immunoreactivity, microphotographsof the ventral horn grey matter were taken at \u00d7 400and, after defining the threshold for background correction,the integrated density of Iba1 labeling was measured using ImageJ software.

Alternate wells were incubated with 10 \u03bcM Ebselen and vehicle (0.1% DMSO) for 24 h followed by replacement of media with PBS containing 0.3 \u03bcM ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD1, Molecular Probes, Paisley, UK). This concentration of Ebselen represents an approximate EC90 for this drug. GFP fluorescence (ARE induction) was then measured at Ex485 nm/Em530 nm using a Fusion universal plate reader (Packard Bioscience). The Z\u2032 score was calculated as follows where SD+ \u00bc standard deviation of positive control wells; SD\u2212 \u00bc standard deviation of negative control wells; Ave+ \u00bc average fluorescence reading of positive control wells; Ave\u2212 \u00bc average fluorescence reading of negative control wells. Signal to noise (S/N\u00bc Ave+/SD+) and signal to background (S/B \u00bc Ave+/Ave\u2212) ratios were also determined for the different assay conditions. Acceptable Z\u2032 scores were >0.5. For the library screen, cells were plated at a density of 20  104 in normal DMEM media containing 10% FBS on Day \u20131 and on Day 0, cells were incubated for 24 h with drug in serum-free media. Media was removed by hand and replaced (1 compound/well) with the Spectrum library diluted to 10 \u03bcM in 0.1% DMSO using a Q-bot liquid handling system (Genetix, New Milton, UK). The media were removed after 24 h and replaced with the same volume of PBS containing 0.3 \u03bcM EthD1. GFP fluorescence (ARE induction, Ex485 nm/Em530 nm) and Eth D1 fluorescence (toxicity Ex530 nm/Em645 nm) were then measured.

All mouse experiments were carried out in accord with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 under a UK Home Office project license reviewed by the Sheffield University Ethical Review Committee Project Applications and Amendments Sub-Committee of the Sheffield University Ethical Review Committee and by the Animal Procedures Committee (London, UK). Pharmacology experiments in SOD1G93A transgenic mice were conducted according to the published guidelines for studies in this model [31]. Mice were originally obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, B6SJL-Tg (SOD1-G93A)1Gur/J (stock number 002726), and were subsequently backcrossed onto the C57Bl/6 background (Harlan UK, C57Bl/6 J OlaHsd) for >20 generations. Power analysis indicated that 13\u201315 mice per group would detect a difference in survival ratio of 10% which is widely accepted as biologically relevant and could detect a difference in time for rotarod performance to decline of 1 week. The litters were split to enable an even distribution of sex and parentage between the two comparison groups and the groups randomly assigned to treatment or control. Previous extensive experiments have indicated that this method of generating control groups provides robust data [36]. Our model, on a defined inbred genetic background, shows no effect of sex or litter of origin on survival [36]. Female SOD1G93A C57BL/6J mice were injected with 10 ml/kg of vehicle (0.1% DMSO in water), or S[+]-apomorphine at 0.5 mg/ml subcutaneously to give a final dose of 5 mg/kg, daily from 21 days of age through to end-stage (complete loss of righting reflex for more than 10 s). Behavioural assessment was carried out blinded to treatment group. Rotarod training was performed over 3 days with 2 trials per day. Subsequently, the rotarod test was performed once per week in the afternoon. On each day, mice were tested twice with a rest period in between tests. The best score was taken for analysis. The rotarod (Ugo Basile 7650) was set to accelerate from 4 to 40 rpm in 300 s. Latency to fall (s) was recorded in seconds for each mouse. The test was performed until mice reached a time of o5 s. The catwalk gait analysis system (Noldus Instruments, version 7.1) was used to capture gait parameters in groups of 5 G93A\u2014transgenic mice and 7 nontransgenic mice. Mice were tested every 2 weeks from 6 weeks of age to 16 weeks of age. They were placed on the catwalk apparatus in complete darkness and the recording of gait patterns was performed in a separate room. Multiple runs were recorded for each mouse and three selected for analysis. Processing of gait data was performed using the dedicated software, with the assignment of limbs performed manually and subsequent automated calculation of gait\nparameters.",

        "text": "Pharmaco kinetic modeling. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for apomorphine was developed in the Simcyp mouse simulator (v11.1) (Simcyp Limited, Sheffield, UK). The following physicochemical data were used: LogP 3.5 (Supplementary Table 2), MW 267.3, compound type monoprotic base (pKa 8.92). A plasma protein binding fraction in mouse of 0.222 (unbound) and a blood: plasma ratio of 1 as measured in humans was assumed [73]. The observed iv clearance of apomorphine in the mouse (109 ml/min/kg, supplementary Table 4) was used to describe the elimination of the compound. Using a fixed value for clearance makes the assumption that clearance is linear across the dose ranges studied. Distribution was predicted using the method of Poulin and Theil as corrected by Berezhkovskiy [74]. The measured brain:plasma (Kp) value (2.1) was used in the model and the Kp values for other tissues were manually adjusted to give a reasonable fit of the observed data. To model exposure after oral dosing a first-order absorption model was used (Fa\u00bc1; Ka\u00bc1.5) After showing that the model could capture the observed plasma and brain levels after iv and oral dosing, simulations were performed to predict plasma and brain concentrations following a 2.5 and 5 mg/kg subcutaneous dose. To do this an extravascular dose was administered such that the AUC was 2.5 or 5 times higher than that at the 1 mg/kg intravenous dose. This assumes that the fraction absorbed following subcutaneous dosing was 1 as has been observed in studies in humans [75]. Simulations were performed with a range of Ka values to give similar Tmax values to those seen following subcutaneous dosing in humans (8\u201316 min) [76].",

Litters were evenly represented across treatment and vehicle groups within each study. Observers were blinded to treatment group identity. Both CuATSM and ATSM were delivered as 3 mg/mL suspensions. CuATSM (American Advanced Scientific, catalog # AAS-11448) and ATSM (American Advanced Scientific, catalog # AAS-11446) were independently suspended in 0.5% Methyl Cellulose (Sigma, M0262) formulated in 0.9% Saline (Sigma, 07982) with the addition of 0.4% Tween 80 (Sigma, P8074). The drug preparations were sonicated for five minutes and mixed by inversion while in use. Formulations were produced daily. Mice were monitored for neurological disease progression according to the protocol detailed by us in the Journal of Visualized Experiments (Hatzipetros et al., 2015). Briefly, the NeuroScore is a five point observation based scoring system. Severity of disease is rated on a scale from 0 to 4 with 0 being asymptomatic and 4 representing a moribund phenotype secondary to paralysis which manifests primarily in the hind limbs of the mice. Neurological scoring procedures and body weight measurements were completed on a bench-top in the animal holding room. End-stage mice were euthanized in a separate procedure room. Euthanasia for animals in all studies was carried out by a Preset Flow System (VetEquip) CO2 chamber. This system is designed to follow the AVMA guidelines displacement rate, 10\u201330% of the chamber volume per minute. End-stage was defined by an inability of the mouse to right itself within 10 s when placed its side. The observing technician was required to test the mouse by placing the animal on both sides. Failure to right itself from either side resulted in euthanasia. Kaplan-Meier curves and long-rank tests were used to analyze age at onset of paresis and survival data using GraphPad Prism 6. Using JMP v10.0.2 statistical software by SAS Institute, Inc, we generated graphs of ordinal expected NeuroScore vs. median age at Neuroscore graphs for drug-treated and vehicle-treated animals by interpolating from the y-axis the median ages at each stage of Neuro Score based disease progression.",

Twenty-four mice were each treated with a single bolus of 30 mg/kg ATSM in a 10 mL/kg volume orally by gavage. Three mice were sacrificed at each timepoint: 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 120 min, 240 min, and 360 min after bolus. Blood samples were harvested by cardiac puncture and collected into K+EDTA tubes. Plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 2000xg for 15 min. For analytical chemistry standards, five microliter aliquots were prepared in 1:1 H2O:acetonitrile and added to 45 microliters of blank control plasma or blank spinal cord homogenate in a 96 deep-well plate. One hundred fifty microliters of acetonitrile containing 500 ng/mL of pyrimethamine as an internal standard and 0.1% formic acid were added to each well. The plate was agitate vigorously and next centrifuged at 500 x g for 30 min at 4\u00b0 C. One hundred microliters of the supernatant from each well were pipetted into a new 96 well plate for LC-MS/MS analyses. Plasma and spinal cord samples from mice that had been treated with ATSM at the defined time points were treated similarly to the standards excepting any ATSM spiking steps. Compartmental modeling of the data was completed using Pharsight Phoenix 64, Build 6.4.0.768, (WinNonlin 6.4). The pharmacokinetics model used was Gauss-Newton (Level and Hartley) nonlinear fitting with uniform weighting.",

Briefly,spinal-cord regions were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and 6 \u03bcm thick sections were cut fromparaffin-embedded tissue. After dewaxing and rehydration endogenous peroxidases were quenched in 30% H2O2 made up in methanol (30 min) and washed in runningtap water (10 min). For antibodies requiring antigen retrieval (only anti-phosphorylated TDP-43) slides wereincubated in a citrate based antigen retrieval (pH 6) buffer(Vector labs #H3300) (15 min at 99 \u00b0C) in an EZ-retriever microwave (BioGenex). Slides and solutionwere placed in a cool tray and left to cool to roomtemperature (~ 20 min). Slides were washed in 0.1 MTris pH 7.6 and blocked in 0.1 M Tris pH 7.6 with 2%FBS. Primary antibodies, in 0.1 M Tris pH 7.6 with 2%FBS, were applied overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Sections werewashed in 0.1 M Tris pH 7.6, blocked in Tris pH 7.6with 2% FBS, and incubated with biotinylated IgG frommouse (1 in 1000, Vector labs #BA-2000) or rat (1 in1000, Vector labs #BA-9401) for 1 h at roomtemperature. Slides were washed in 0.1 M Tris pH 7.6 and then 0.1 M Tris pH 7.6 with 2% FBS and incubatedwith an avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (VectastainABC kit, #PK-6100) made up in Tris pH 7.6 with2% FBS (1 h at room temperature). Slides were washedin Tris pH 7.6 and developed with Diaminiobenzidine(DAB) solution (Vector labs, SK-4105) for 8 min atroom temperature. Slides were counterstained with Harrishematoxylin (30 s), washed in running tap water(10 min) dehydrated, cleared in xylene and mounted incytoseal XYL (ThermoFisher, #8312\u20134). All Tris basedwashes were 5 min. Primary antibodies used were ratanti-phosphorylated (pS409/410) TDP-43 monoclonalantibody (1 in 500, [83]) and mouse anti-PAR, BSA free(1 in 500, Tulip Biolabs, #1020 N). Note, antigen retrievaland cooling steps were omitted for anti-PAR labelling.The anti-PAR antibody was first optimized by aserial dilution test (from 1 in 400 to 1 in 25, 000). Nosignal was detected at 1 in 25, 000 indicating that thesecondary antibody was not contributing to the observedsignal at higher primary concentrations. Dilution testswere performed on spinal cord tissue from 5 normalcases and 4 ALS cases.Slides were coded and blinded and quantified by tworesearchers independently. For nuclear PAR scoring, 1\u20135sections from every case were quantified and all thealpha motor neurons present in the anterior horns ofeach of section were scored for whether the nucleus waspresent and, if so, whether the nucleus stained for PAR.If all motor neurons with a nucleus were negative forPAR the score was 0. If 1 or more motor neurons withnuclei visible in the section were present and stained fornuclear PAR: a score of + was given if nuclear PAR waspresent in 1 motor neuron and ++ if more than 1 motorneuron stained for nuclear PAR. To determine the numberof alpha motor neurons in ALS and normal spinalcord, motor neurons from one anterior horn from eachcase were counted. In the ALS anterior horn, there were13.7\u00b11.4 (SEM) alpha motor neurons with 4.0\u00b10.4(SEM) nuclei exposed. In the normal anterior horn,there were 19.5\u00b11.4 (SEM) alpha motor neurons with5.6\u00b10.6 (SEM) nuclei exposed.",

For image analysis and quantification, the chamber was divided vertically into ten 100 \u03bcm zones (permissive zones or bins) along the gradient. Each zone represents an average range of rapamycin concentration based on a linear concentration profile. Fluorescenceintensity, corresponding to the number of positive cells (in our case, motor neurons) was plotted against therapamycin concentration. GFP+cells were counted using ImageJ (NIH). As individual cells were not resolved atthe low magnification (5x), fluorescent intensities were used to quantify cells. An \u2018unsharp mask\u2019 was applied,followed by cell count (particle analysis). A native eGFP response on 7DIV(day-7) was used as the baseline forGFP expression. ANOVA in conjunction with an appropriate multiple comparison test was performed for statisticalsignificance (for a detailed comparison, see Sheet S1 ). A high resolution imaging for the localization ofnuclear TDP-43 to that of cytoplasmic TDP-43 without destroying the positional construct (gradient zones) wasnot possible in the microdevice samples (Figs. 6, 7a). The reason for this is, high resolution images are ratherdifficult to obtain in thick 3D cultures, even using confocal or epifluorescence techniques due to constraintsimposed by light scattering and absorptive processes. This, as well as the propensity of ESCs to cluster, is oneof the disadvantages of the 3D microfluidic approach and why high-resolution images were only provided forthe planar 2D cultures. A higher magnification image of a typical MN cluster in the microdevice showing theirmorphology is indicated in supplementary figure S4. This scattering/clustering does not preclude quantitative assessments of the total fluorescence or expression, which is the metric used in the 3D microdevice analysis asoutlined and referenced in our previous publication43.",

After removing themeninges, the ventral horn was separated from the dorsal horn. The dorsal horn was discarded,and each ventral horn was cut into pieces of 500  m. The tissue pieces were digested in enzymedigestion solution containing 0.02% DNase and 36 U/mL Papain in an isolation medium (0.5 mMGlutaMax, 100 U/mL Pen/Strep, 2% B27 supplement in Hibernate A) on a shaker for 5 min at roomtemperature and for an additional 25 min at 30  C. After centrifugation at 1040  g for 5 min at roomtemperature, the supernatant was discarded. After trituration of the tissue, an OptiPrep densitygradient centrifugation according to Brewer und Torricelli 2007 [41] was performed, to separatespinal cord cells from detritus and erythrocytes. Layer 2 and 3 according to Brewer and Torricelli2007 [41] were collected in an isolation medium and centrifuged at 244  g for 6 min at 10  C. The pelletwas resuspended in 1 mL motor neuron feeding medium (MFM; MBM supplemented with 30%C2C12 myocyte-conditioned medium, 125 mM cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), 1 ng/mLbrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), 0.1 ng/mL glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)).The cells were counted and seeded with a density of 70,000 cells/well on a 50  g/mL poly-d-lysine(PDL)-laminated 12 mm glass slide. The medium was exchanged on the subsequent day of thepreparation and afterwards, every second day.For investigations concerning the influence of NAD+ and an increased Nmnat2 level on the growthof motor neurons, the medium was completed with 10 mM NAD+ or 10  M ca eine according toprevious studies [22,25]. The motor neuronal feeding medium was replaced by the extended mediumfrom the day of preparation until the day of fixation. Cells were cultured for 7, 10 or 14 days.",

Transgenic SOD1G93A mice were originally obtained from Jackson Laboratories (002726), which express about 20 copies of mutant human SOD1 with a Gly93Ala substitution (B6SJLTg- SOD1G93A-1Gur). The genotypes of the transgenic mice were identified by PCR according to our previously reported reference.14 Male SOD1G93A mice were randomly divided into 3 groups (Tg-NT, Tg-Suc, Tg-Tre) with 21 mice in each group and these mice were housed under the conditions of constant temperature and controlled lighting (light/dark period 12/12 h). We chose 2% trehalose treatment for SOD1G93A mice according to previous reports.24,25 For Tg-Tre mice, 2% trehalosecontaining water was given to SOD1G93A mice through ad libitum consumption, starting at 64 d of age and continuing until the day the mice died. We calculated that the average water consumption of each mouse was 5 to 6 ml per day. For Tg-Suc mice, 2% sucrose-containing water was given to mice as a vehicle control. For Tg-NT mice, no treatment was given to SOD1G93A mice. In addition, 15 of the age-matched WT littermates were used as controls. All the transgenic mice were weighed every 4 d starting from 64 d of age until death and the monitoring of WT mice was ended at 146 d of age.

Ltd; Bangalore, India) in two sequential steps, by anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography, according to previously reported methods [13, 14]. The cake powder PKM2 was treated with boiling 70% ethanol in order to quickly deactivate the endogenous enzyme myrosinase. GMG was extracted using an Ultraturrax homogenizer at a medium speed for 15min and the resulting homogenatewas centrifuged at 17,700 \u00d7g for 30min. The isolation of GMG from the extract was carried out by one-step anion exchange chromatography. The extract was loaded on a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy) anion-exchange column (150 \u00d7 26 mm) conditioned with 25mM acetate buffer (pH 5.6). After washing with 1 L of distilled water, GMG was eluted with 500mL of aqueousK2SO4 0.2M.The eluatewas concentratedtodryness using a rotary evaporator at 60\u201370\u2218C under vacuum. Three subsequent extractions were carried out with 70\u2013100mL of boiling methanol. Then, the alcoholic extract was filtered and concentrated to 15\u201320% of the initial volume. The solution was warmed and slowly added dropwise to 200mL of ethanol that was previously cooled to \u221220\u2218C. This led to the precipitation of a white powder. After centrifugation, the solid GMG (as potassium salt) was dried and sealed under vacuumto preventmoisture uptake by the highly hygroscopic compound.The purity of the GMG was further improved by gel-filtration performed using an XK 26/100 column packed with Sephadex G10 (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatograph system (AKTA FPLC System, GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy). The mobile phase was water at a flow rate of 2.0mLmin\u22121, and the eluate absorbance was monitored at 254 nm. After the void volume was discarded, 5mL fractions were collected and analysed by HPLC and those containing pure GMG were pooled and freeze-dried.The purity was assayed by HPLC analysis of the desulfo-derivative according to the ISO 9167-1 method [18] yielding about 99% based on peak area value (Figure 2), and more than 95% on weight basis, due to its high hygroscopic properties, was determined by a calibration curve of standard desulfo-GMG available in our laboratory. The enzyme Myr was isolated from seeds of Sinapis alba L. according to a reported method with some modifications [19]. Briefly, the enzyme was extracted from white mustard seeds with water and purified by affinity chromatography on  Con A-Sepharose. Then, the active fractions coming from affinity chromatography were pooled and dialyzed against 50mM phosphate buffer pH 6.5 containing 0.15M NaCl. The dialyzed Myr solution was concentrated and loaded into a prepacked Superdex 200 HiLoad 26/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50mMphosphate buffer pH 6.5 containing 0.15M NaCl connected with a fast protein liquid chromatograph system (AKTA FPLC System, GEHealthcare,Milan, Italy).Theactive fractionswere pooled and concentrated by Millipore Amicon Stirred Cell Model 8400 using a UF membrane 30KDaMWCO (Millipore).The stock solution used in the present study had a specific activity of 60 units/mg of soluble protein.The enzymatic activity was 32U/mL and the solution was stored at 4\u2218C in sterile saline solution at neutral pH until use. One Myr unit was defined as the amount of enzyme able to hydrolyze 1\ud835\udf07mol/min of sinigrin at pH 6.5 and 37\u2218C.",

Since the Taconic industry disease onset occurs around 115 days of life (about 16 weeks), our experiments were planned to treat SOD1tg rats starting from 14 weeks. Consequently, the sacrifice was established when in the GMG-ITC SOD1tg group are appeared the first signs of disease (about 18 weeks of life). At the end of the experiment, blood was collected by cardiac puncture and animals were euthanized. Brain tissue and spleen were sampled and processed in order to evaluate disease parameters.",

Noninvasive behavioral evaluations were made without causing excessive animal stress in order to provide data about muscular degeneration/locomotor activity loss. Hanging Wire Test (HWT) was performed to evaluate motor performance.The test consists in the capability of the animal into staying hanged to a wire for a time period of 90sec, using the paw strength. HWT was performed two times aweek starting from fourweeks before the disease onset and two weeks later and for a total number of fifteen tests. Also Open Field Test (OFT) for motor function was performed to test behavior and general motor function. GMGITC treated as well as untreated SOD1tg rats were monitored for a time period of 180 sec to assess the spontaneous activity in an open field, consisting of a white Plexiglas box (100 cm\u00d7 100 cm) with the floor divided into 16 squares. Four squares were defined as the center and 12 squares along the walls as the periphery. Each animal was gently placed in the center of the box and activity was scored as a line crossing when a mouse removed all four paws fromone square and entered another. Immediately after each test, the apparatus was thoroughly cleaned with cotton pad wetted with 70% ethanol. The test was performed once a week starting from two weeks before the disease onset and two weeks later, with the last measure performed the day before the sacrifice and for a total number of six tests.",

The counterstain was developed with diaminobenzidine (brown color) and ematossilin (blue background). To verify the binding specificity, some sections were also incubated with only the primary antibody or with only the secondary antibody. In these situations, absence of positive staining was found in the sections, indicating that the immunoreaction was positive in all the experiments carried out.

The pellets were suspended in the supplied complete lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150mM NaCl, 10mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1mM EGTA, and 1mM EDTA protease inhibitors tablets (Roche), and then they were centrifuged for 30min at 15,000 g at 4\u2218C, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected to evaluate the content of nuclear proteins. Supernatants were stored at \u221280\u2218C until use. Protein concentration in homogenate was estimated by Bio-Rad ProteinAssay (Bio-Rad, Segrate, Italy) using BSA as standard, and 20 \ud835\udf07g of cytosol and nuclear extract from each sample were analyzed. Proteins were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide minigels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran nitrocellulose transfer membrane; Whatman Schleicher and Schuell,Dassel, Germany), blocked with PBS containing 5%nonfat dried milk (PM) for 45min at roomtemperature, and subsequently probed at 4\u2218Covernight with the follow primary antibodies: TNF-alpha (1 : 100 in PM 0.1% Tween 20 (PMT) v/v; Cell Signaling Technologies), FoxP3 (1 : 500 in PMT v/v; eBioscience), and cleaved-caspase3 (1 : 1000 in PMT v/v; Cell Signaling Technologies). HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were incubated as secondary antibodies (1 : 2000 in PMT v/v; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. To ascertain that blots were loaded with equal amounts of proteic lysates, they were also incubated with GAPDH-HRP conjugated primary antibody (1 : 1000 in PMT v/v; Cell Signaling Technology). Relative protein bands expression was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Luminata Forte, Western HRP substrate, Millipore) and proteic bands were acquired and quantified with ChemiDoc MP System (Bio- Rad, Segrate, Italy) and a computer program (ImageJ software), respectively. Blots are representative of three separate and reproducible experiments. Statistical analysis was run on three repeated blots performed on separate experiments.",

RNA seq was performed on all 4 males and 4 females from each group (vehicle, estrogen, tamoxifen and raloxifene) for a total of 32 mice in technical duplicates. Flash frozen spinal cord tissue was sent to Genewiz (South Plainfield, NJ) for next generation RNA sequencing. Raw.fastq files were supplied and are available for analysis on the BioJupies cloud (https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/biojupies/ analyze/tools?uid=ETXiK0nxxgj) (25) Analysis of RNA-seq fastq files was performed using the BioJupies suite of tools for alignment, annotation, and differential expression analysis of our treatment groups. Differentially expressed genes that were significantly (adjusted P < .05) up- or downregulated compared with vehicle control or estrogen treatment were used for further gene ontology enrichment analysis using the ontology enrichment analysis tool for biological processes provided by the Gene Ontology Consortium or the suite of analysis tools provided through Enrichr. The complete set of links to data generated in Biojupies can be found in Table 1 and (25). Differential gene expression was determined in Biojupies with built-in scripts currently used in limma (37).",

Body weight was assessed weekly starting the day prior to pellet implantation. Forepaw muscle strength was measured using a digital grip strength meter (Columbus Instruments). Animals were trained to grasp a horizontal grasping ring. During the testing phase, the average of 3 trials recorded at 5-minute intervals was recorded per mouse. The age of death or the age at which institutional guidelines required euthanasia were recorded for each animal and used to construct a Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curve.

Analysis of quantitative and qualitative protein expression was performed with a standard western blot technique on whole brainstem treated asdescribed above in accordance with the previously published protocol.70 Totallysates, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions were analyzed.

A hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.9 with1.5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM KCl plus protease inhibitors mixture and reducingagents) was used to process samples for membrane and cytoplasmic extraction,which were then centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 r.p.m. at 4 \u00b0C and the supernatanttransferred to ultracentrifuge tubes for centrifugation (1 h) at 100 000 g. Cytoplasmicproteins were considered those in the supernant, whereas the pellet was formed bymembrane proteins, which were re-suspended in the extraction buffer (20 mMHEPES pH 7.9, with 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1% SDS plusprotease inhibitors mixture and reducing agents).

Transgenic (TG) SOD1-G93A mice overexpressing high-level human mutant SOD1-G93A gene were originally obtained from Jackson Laboratories (B6SJL-Tg- SOD1- G93A- 1Gur/ J, 002726). This mouse model has been reported to become paralyzed in hindlimbs on average 99.27 \u00b1 1. 79 days, while female mice show later onsets than male mice and death at 135.77 \u00b1 2.93 days.19 The mice were maintained as hemizygotes by crossing TG males with wild-type (WT) females of the same B6SJL genetic background. The genotype of the TG mice was identified by PCR according to our previous report.14 Carbamazepine (ab141785, Abcam) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and then, the mixture was diluted with water to a final concentration of 10 mg/ mL (DMSO concentration 4%). The maximum applicable dose of CBZ is 20 mg/kg in human, taking into account the higher ratio of surface area to body weight and previous study,16 we chose 200 mg/kg as the therapeutic dose of CBZ for mice. No significant side effect under this dosage was observed throughout the course of treatment. Thirty-six female TG mice were randomized into CBZ-treated group (TG-CBZ) and DMSO-treated group (TG-DMSO) with 18 mice per group. In TG-CBZ group, mice were orally administered with CBZ at 200 mg/kg once daily (via gavage, 0.2 mL/10 g body weight). In TG-DMSO group, mice were treated with an equal volume of 4% DMSO once daily. Although SOD1-G93A mice have no obvious symptoms at 60 days of age, there had been some mild pathological changes in spinal cord including minor MNs loss.20 Therefore, CBZ treatment was started from 64 days (on the 10th weeks) of age until the animal\u2019s death. Simultaneously, 36 age-and sex-matched wild-type (WT) littermates were divided into WT-CBZ and WT-DMSO groups. In each group, twelve mice were used for assessing the disease onset and life span. The rest of the mice were sacrificed at 120 days of age, and their tissues were subjected to Western blot analysis (3 mice per group) or pathological staining analysis as described below. The body weight of all mice was measured every 4 days from the first drug administration to death. All experiments were conducted according to the principles established for the care and use of laboratory animals by the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Dalian Medical University.",

If a mouse fell down from the apparatus within 5 minutes, the other 2 tests will be performed after 20-minutes rest. The mice were recorded as a disease onset when the longest run time was less than 5 minutes. As for the life span, the time of animals death was defined as the day when mice could no longer right themselves when they were placed on their back for 30 seconds.22 Mice were then sacrificed to reduce further pain from respiratory failure according to animal care guidelines.",

While the PaGE test evaluates the ability of a mouse to support its own body weight using only forelimbs and hindlimbs against gravity, body weight varies between individual mice, in part because of the heterogeneous C57BL/J6\u00d7SJL F1 hybrid genetic background. Therefore, the PaGE test is limited in its ability to accurately measure forelimb and hindlimb muscle strength of an individual mouse. To overcome this limitation, mice were presented with an irongrid with a fixed weight of 24 g. The irongrid was 5.5 cm\u00d78 cm, and was constructed with an iron wire 1.0 mm in diameter. To elicit gripping, the irongrid was presented to each mouse. By lifting the grid up, the mice was required to hold its own body with its forelimbs and hindlimbs against the pull of gravity. The time that each mouse held onto the grid was recorded. Each mouse was given up to three trials to hold onto the grid for 10 sec, and the longest latency time was recorded.",

Fixed cords were cut coronally into 40 \u03bcm-thick sections with a vibratome (Leica VT 1000S; Leica Instruments, Nussloch, Germany). Cord sections were stained with 1% cresyl violet and the numbers of stained cells were determined using the TOMORO ScopeEye 3.6 system (Olympus, Japan) as previously described [31, 32]. For immunohistochemistry, free-floating sections were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4) for 1 h. Sections were then incubated with anti-HNE (Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc., TX, USA) or anti-ChAT (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) antibodies at 4oC overnight. The sections were then washed with PBST and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies diluted 1:200 in PBST. Immunoreactive regions were visualized using an ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA, USA). Anti- HNE stained sections were incubated with TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) diluted 1:200 in PBST. After washing, the sections were mounted with VECTASHIELD\u00ae Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories).

Twice a week, mice (transgenic and control) were intra-peritoneally injected with either gacyclidine (two different concentrations; 1 mg/kg or 0.1 mg/kg) (Neur\u00e9va, Montpellier, France) or NaCl. The treatment doses were determined according to the following criteria: the dose of 1 mg/kg corresponds to the acute therapeutic dose in rat (Feldblum et al., 2000; Gaviria et al., 2000b) and we wanted to test the possible toxic effect of a chronic administration. Repeated administration of low dose of non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists induces hyperlocomotion in rat (Wolf and Khansa, 1991; Loscher and Honack, 1992; Matsuoka et al., 2005). Injections were thus not done daily not only to reduce the risk of peritonitis but also to prevent possible interference of injections with behavioral tests. Treatment started at 60 days of age and was carried until the death of the animal.

As previously described (Gerber et al., 2012a) we selected amongst locomotor patterns, the \u201crelative position\u201d that corresponds to the distance between the placement of front and hind paws over one walking step. For data collection, six runs per animal were performed on a weekly basis from day 60 (just prior the first injection) and until animals were not able to correctly cross the walkway due to hindlimb paralysis. For each mouse, a minimum of three runs crossed at the same speed with 3-full step sequence patterns per run were recorded. To accustom the animals to the environment and thus to avoid bias due to stress, we placed transgenic and control littermates mice on the CatWalk 7 and 3 days prior to the first recording session. Catwalk analyses started before the first injection, the next behavioral session was done at least 72 h after treatment. Recordings were performed until the failure to obtain satisfactory paw patterns with the CatWalk analysis system due to hindlimb paralysis and thus absence of paw detection in the transgenic groups. Data analysis was done in collaboration with InnovationNet (Tiranges, France).",

To measure survival of motoneurons and interneurons, cultures were immunolabeled and counted as previously described (Sepulveda et al., 2010; Castillo et al., 2013; Fritz et al., 2013; Rojas et al., 2014). Briefly, primary spinal cultures were fixed at 7 DIV with 4% paraformaldehyde, and immunostained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against MAP2 (1:400; Cat. No. sc-20172; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to label all neurons (interneurons plus motoneurons) and with a mouse monoclonal SMI-32 antibody (1:600, Cat. No. SMI-32R; Sternberger Monoclonals) to reveal the presence of unphosphorylated neurofilament-H, which is expressed specifically in motoneurons in spinal cord cultures (Urushitani et al., 2006; Nagai et al., 2007); previously we found that our WT primary spinal cultures typically contain at least 8\u201310% motoneurons until 12 DIV (Sepulveda et al., 2010). Fluorescent neurons were visualized with epifluorescent illumination on an Olympus IX81 microscope or on a Nikon C1 confocal microscope on which stacks of 0.50-\u03bcm optical sections were acquired through entire neurons. Labeling patterns were documented with a 20x objective and a Q-Imaging Micropublisher 3.3 Real-Time Viewing camera; MAP2- and SMI-32-positive neurons were counted off-line within 20 randomly chosen fields, and the percentage of SMI-32-positive motoneurons within the total number of MAP2-positive cells was calculated.

Coronal sections of the lumbar spinal cord (L3\u2013L6) with a thickness of 20 \u03bcm were prepared using a cryostat (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and collected on gelatine-coated glass slides.Spinal cord sections were immunolabeled with the primary antibodies (anti-ChAT, 1:100, Millipore; anti-Iba1, 1:500, WAKO, Osaka, Japan) and subsequently with the respective secondary antibodies (Cy3 anti-goat or Cy2/Dylight anti-rabbit; both Dianova).In order to quantify MN numbers in the ventral horn of coronal cryosections from the lumbar spinal cord, cells in the ventral horn were counted as MN if they had a clearly identifiable nucleolus, were at least 200 \u03bcm2 in size and were ChAT-positive. At least ten sections per mouse spinal cord including both ventral horns being at least 100 \u03bcm apart over a length of at least 1000 \u03bcm from the lumbar spinal cord were counted.

Microgliosis was evaluated by the quantification of Iba1 positive cells in the ventral horn of lumbar spinal cord sections. In contrast to the MN analysis MG were not confined to ventral horn region. Therefore, the ventral horn area was measured and Iba1 positive cells were manually counted and plotted as cell numbers per 0.2 mm2. A total number of nine mice each gender was analyzed from vehicle (n = 3), Fas30 (n = 3) and Fas100 (n = 3).

WT littermates were used as controls. Mice were transcardially perfused with PFA 4%. The rostral part of the spinal cord was frozen for further analysis, and the caudal part was used for histological motor neuron analysis and immunohistochemistry. Lumbar spinal cords were dissected, embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT, Tissue-Tek; Scigen Scientific, Gardena, CA, USA), sectioned (10 \u00b5m) using a cryostat, and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). To compare the number of motor neurons, we counted the large motor neurons (greater than 25 \u00b5m in diameter) in the ventral horn gray matter in 9 lumbar spinal cord sections from each animal. The results of motor neuron counting were expressed as the average of total motor neurons counted per one ventral horn in each group. For immunohistochemistry, slides were incubated with blocking solution (5% goat serum, 1% Bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton-X in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) for 1 h. Then, slides were incubated overnight at 4 \u25e6C with the following primary antibodies: rat anti-GFAP (1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), goat anti-ChAT (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse anti-S100\u03b2 (1:10; Abcam), and goat anti-IBA1 (1:200; Abcam). Then, sections were incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor anti goat-488, anti-mouse-488, or anti rat-568 (1:200\u20131:1000; Invitrogen) for 1 h. The nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Microscopic pictures were taken by ApoTome microscope (ZEISS, Jena, Germany).

        "text": "Microglial cultures and manipulations. Walker EOC-20 cells (Walker et al. 1995; Hensley et al. 2003) and L292 murine fibroblasts were obtained from the American Tissue Type Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). EOC-20 cells are a well characterized, non-virus transformed, colony-stimulating factor-1- dependent mouse microglial cell line that expresses typical macrophage cell surface markers including IgG receptors FccRI and II, Mac-1, Mac-2, Mac-3, CD45 and CD80 (Walker et al. 1995). EOC-20 microglia express major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I constitutively and express MHC-II in response to c-interferon (Walker et al. 1995). EOC-20 cells therefore closely resemble primary macrophages and microglia with respect to the presence and inducibility of cell-surface antigens. The response of EOC-20 cells to archetypal inflammatory stimuli has been described recently (Hensley et al. 2003). EOC-20 cells were grown in 75-cm2 cell culture flasks until passaged into 24-well cell culture plates. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 20% L292 fibroblast-conditioned medium. L292 cells secrete colony-stimulating factor-1, which promotes microglial proliferation. Recombinant murine TNFa was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA) or Sigma Chemical (St Louis, MO, USA) and reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline plus 4% endotoxin-free bovine serum albumin. The dose of TNFa was determined for each batch of cytokine in order to stimulate a 24-h NO2 \u2013 production of approximately 25 lM (typically 20 ng/mL TNFa). EOC-20 cells were treated with test compounds dissolved in dimthylsulfoxide (DMSO), or with DMSO vehicle alone (1% final volume) for 30 min before challenge with TNFa. Each test agent was administered at serial 1 : 5 dilutions from 100 lM down to 800 nM, with four replicate wells per dose. After stimulation for 24 h with TNFa, the culture medium was removed and assayed for NO2 \u2013 using the Griess assay (Marzinzig et al. 1997) with commercially available diazotization reagents (LabChem Inc., Pittsburg, PA, USA). NO2 \u2013 concentrations were interpolated to calculate the concentration of drug that suppressed TNFa-induced NO2 \u2013 by 50% (IC50 value). The medium was then replaced with Dulbecco\u2019s minimal essential medium lacking phenol red indicator. A commercially available MTS reagent [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2- yl)-5-(3-carboxymethonyphenol)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; Promega, Madison, WI, USA] was added to each well according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. After incubation for 30\u201345 min at 37 C, aliquots of medium were removed and evaluated spectrophotometrically at 540 nm. A blank was prepared in which the MTS solution was incubated in the absence of cells; this was taken to indicate 0% viability. Viability was formally calculated as the ratio of OD540 in the drug-treated wells, relative to the same variable measured in wells treated with TNFa alone, after subtraction of the blank. An agent was considered cytotoxic if the ratio of LD50 to IC50 was less than 10. Synthetic mesonordihydroguaiaretic acid [NDGA or 1,4-bis(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)- 2,3-dimethylbutane] was obtained from Sigma or Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA) and used in all animal experiments as well as most cell culture experiments. In specific cell culture experiments natural NDGAwas obtained from Sigma. ELISAs for leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were purchased from Cayman Chemical (San Diego, CA, USA).",

Transgenic mice were maintained in the hemizygous state by mating G93A males with B6SJL-TGN females. Animals were fed ad libitum standard AIN93G diets or the same diets formulated with NDGA at 2500 p.p.m. with drug administration started at 90 days. At this stage of life, G93A-SOD1 animals begin to demonstrate motor weakness and fine limb tremors (Gue\u00b4gan and Przedborski 2003). The feeding study used 16 mice per group. The group receiving NDGA consisted of five male and 11 female mice; the control group consisted of four male and 12 female mice. All diets and dietary drug formulations were provided by Dyets, Inc. (Bethlehem, PA, USA). All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. Motor performance was evaluated by means of a rotarod task, by a technician blinded to the treatment groups. Mice were placed on a horizontal rod that was made to rotate at 1 r.p.m. with an acceleration rate of 1 r.p.m. every 10 s until the animal fell from the rod. Each animal was tested three times per trial. Rotarod tests were conducted at 90 days (baseline), 100 days of age and subsequent 5-day intervals. Animals were killed when no longer able to right themselves within 10 s of being placed on their sides. Statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad PrismTM statistical analysis package (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).",

Total RNA was isolated from spinal cords of non-transgenic control and G93A+ transgenic mice by using TRI Reagent (Sigma) according to the supplier\u2019s protocol. Samples of RNA (5 lg) were reverse transcribed using oligo(dT)15 to prime the reaction in the presence of avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) RT (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. On completion, each reaction was diluted to a final volume of 50 lL with TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). PCR amplification of a 309-bp 5LOX gene product from the above-described mouse cDNAs was accomplished with Taq DNA polymerase (Roche), utilizing the buffer supplied and final concentrations of 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP and 0.3 lM of each primer. Final reaction volumes were 50 lL. Mouse 5LOX primers were 5\u00a2- GGCACCGACGACTACATCTAC-3\u00a2 (forward) and 5\u00a2-CAATTTTGCACGTCCATCCC-3\u00a2 (reverse). Beta-actin primers [5\u00a2- CGGCCAGGTCATCACTATTG-3\u00a2 (forward) and ACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCAC-3\u00a2 (reverse)] yielding a 353-bp PCR product were used as normalization controls. The number of PCR amplification cycles was determined empirically to yield detectable product bands that were approximately linear with respect to initial cDNA concentration. For 5LOX, optimal cycling conditions were: 2 min at 94C, one cycle; 1 min at 94C, 1 min at 56C and 1 min at 72C for 27 cycles; 7 min at 72C, one cycle. Conditions for actin primers were the same except that an annealing temperature of 54C was used and 24 cycles were performed. Samples of 25 lL from each reaction were electrophoresed in 2% agarose/TBE [tris/borate/ EDTA buffer (0.09 M Tris, 0.09 M borate, 0.002 M EDTA)] gels for 1.5 h, stained with ethidium bromide and photographed with a NucleoVision (Nucleotech, Westport, CT, USA) imaging system.5LOX is increased in G93A-SOD1 mouse spinal cord.",

Monoclonal anti-5LOX was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington KY, USA). Polyclonal antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was purchased from Research Diagnostics International (Flanders, NJ, USA). The positive control for 5LOX western blots was SL-29 fibroblast lysate (Transduction Laboratories; provided with the antibody). Electrophoresis was performed on 4\u201320% gradient polyacrylamide gels, and bands were visualized with chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Cleaved microtubule-associated tau protein (C-tau) was measured in the heat-soluble fraction of total spinal cord lysate as described previously (Zemlan 1999; Zemlan and Jauch 1999; Zemlan et al. 1999). Spinal cord samples were homogenized in in 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 6.8), 0.3 M NaCl, 1% b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 lM leupeptin. Homogenates were centrifuged at 30 000 g for 5 min at 4C. Supernanants were boiled for 10 min then centrifuged for 30 min at 30 000 g and 4C. The final supernatants were dialyzed overnight against 50 mM Tris-HCl. C-tau levels in these heat-soluble fractions were measured by sandwich ELISA as described previously, using affinity-purified monoclonal antibody 12B2 (Zemlan 1999; Zemlan and Jauch 1999; Zemlan et al. 1999). For immunohistochemistry, mice were terminally anesthetized and perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. The spinal cord was removed and the lumbar L5 region was processed for paraffin embedding. Serial cross-sections of the L5 spinal cord region were cut at 5 lM thickness. Immunostaining was performed using serial L5 spinal cord sections with antibodies to glial GFAP (dilution 5 lg/mL; Chemicon). Negative immunohistochemical controls were treated in the same way but in the absence of primary antibody. GFAP-labeled sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.",

Three trials were performed, and if mice were no longer able to stay on the rod for at least 10 min, this was used as a sign of disease onset, as well as the appearance of tremor of the hind legs and gait abnormalities. Starting at day 70 of age and continued until mice were unable to perform the task, motor function was also assessed twice a week by a 12 rpm paradigm: the time that mice stayed on the rod (until falling off or staying for a maximum of 5 min) was recorded as a measurement of the competence of their motor function.

Four groups of animals were used for histological evaluation at 110 days of age: wild-type mice (n = 5), ALS G93A SOD1 transgenic mice receiving vehicle treatment (n = 6), G93A SOD1 transgenic mice receiving DP-109 treatment (n = 4) or DP-460 (n = 8) treatment. Mice were perfused transcardially with cold 0.1 mol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 min followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. The spinal cords were carefully dissected and the lumbar segments were identified using the ribs and the vertebrae as guide. Tissues were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 6 h. Blocks were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 24 h. Serial coronal sections (50 lm thick) were cut through the lumbar (L1 fi L4) spinal cord enlargement of the wild type, vehicle, DP109, and DP-460 treated G93A mice. One set of sections was mounted onto gelatin-coated slides and stained for Nissl substance using cresyl violet. Unbiased stereological counts of Nissl-stained motor neurons in the ventral horn were determined in 10 serial non adjacent (250 lm apart) sections using the optical fractionator method. Analysis was performed using a system consisting of a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with a computer-controlled LEP BioPoint motorized stage, a DEI-750 video camera, a Dell Dimension 4300 computer, and the Stereo Investigator (v. 4.35) software program (Microbrightfield, Burlington, VT, USA). Cell counts were made within an area demarcated by a horizontal line drawn through the central canal and encompassing the ventral horn of the gray matter to include layers 7\u20139. The size of the x\u2013y sampling grid was 200 lm. The counting frame thickness was 14 lm and the counting frame area was 4900 lm2. Data were expressed as the means \u00b1 SEM. Differences among means were analyzed using ANOVA followed by Newman\u2013Keuls post hoc test. The coefficient of error and coefficient of variation were also determined. A separate set of sections was collected as free-floating sections and processed for immunohistochemistry using a modified avidin\u2013 biotin peroxidase technique. The following antibodies were used: rat anti-CD40 (1 : 100; Serotec, Raleigh, NC, USA), goat anti-CD40L (1 : 1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-4-hydroxynonenal (1 : 1000; Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland), rabbit polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine, goat antiTNF-a (1 : 100; Serotec), and sheep anti-a-synuclein (1 : 1000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). The immunoreaction was visualized using 3,3\u00a2-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride dihydrate with nickel intensification (Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) as the chromogen. The sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides, dehydrated, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped.",

From 75 days of age, each animal in all experimental groups were weighed twice a week and from 110 days, all animals were observed and weighed daily. In these experiments, mice were determined as having reached end-stage when they had either lost 15% of their maximum bodyweight (as measured at 75 days) or lost the ability to right themselves within 20 s when turned on their back. At this point, animals were humanely killed. For lifespan analysis, a total of 75 SODG93A mice were assessed, divided into the following treatment groups: vehicle treated SODG93A mice (n = 30), SODG93A mice treated with arimoclomol from 75 days (n = 21) and SODG93A mice treated with arimoclomol from 90 days (n = 24).

        "text": "Physiological assessment of muscle function and motor unit number. For the physiological assessment of muscle function and motor unit survival, a separate set of experimental mice were established (n = 51): Experimental groups included wild-type (WT) mice (n = 6); SODG93A mice treated with arimoclomol (i.p) from 75 days (n = 20); SODG93A mice treated with arimoclomol (i.p) from 90 days (n = 20) as well as SODG93A mice treated with vehicle (saline; n = 24). Each SODG93A experimental group was subdivided into male and female gender groups and each gender group consisted of at least 10 mice. In addition, a number of female SODG93A mice were treated orally with arimoclomol from 35 days (n = 5). When the mice were 120-day old, they were deeply anesthetized (4.5% chloral hydrate; 1mL/100 g of body weight, i.p) and prepared for in vivo analysis of muscle function. The distal tendons of the TA and the EDL muscles in both hindlimbs were dissected free and attached by silk thread to isometric force transducers (Dynamometer UFI Devices, Welwyn Garden City, UK). The sciatic nerve was exposed and sectioned, and all branches cut except for the deep peroneal nerve that innervates the TA and EDL muscles. The length of the muscles was adjusted for maximum twitch tension and the muscle and nerves were kept moist with saline throughout the recordings. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (23C). Isometric contractions were elicited by stimulating the nerve to EDL and TA using square-wave pulses of 0.02 ms duration at supra-maximal intensity, via silver wire electrodes. Contractions were elicited by trains of stimuli at frequencies of 40, 80, and 100 Hz. The maximum tetanic tension was measured using a computer and appropriate software (Scope, Loredan Biomedical, Davis, CA, USA). The number of motor units innervating the EDL muscles was determined by stimulating the motor nerve with stimuli of increasing intensity, resulting in step wise increments in twitch tension because of successive recruitment of motor axons. The number of stepwise increments was counted to give an estimate of the number of motor units present in each EDL muscles.Effect of arimoclomol on muscle function in SODG93A mice",

Samples were spun at 17 530 g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad assay system (Bi-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK; Cat#: 500-0116) and a series of BSA standards. Inducible Hsp70 in mouse tissue samples was measured by ELISA as described elsewhere (Kustanova et al. 2006). In brief, ATP was conjugated to ovalbumin and immobilized onto the surface of a medium binding capacity ELISA plate (Greiner, Solingen, Germany). Immobilization was performed at 37C for 1 h in buffer T (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2). Buffer T, containing 0.2% Tween 20 (T-Tw), was then used for blocking as well as for all subsequent steps and washes. Calibration standards of pure Hsp70 (Stressgen, Assay Designs Inc, Ann Harbor, MI, USA; NSP-555) and mouse tissue extracts in T-Tw were applied to the wells for 1 h, after which the wells were washed and anti-Hsp70 rabbit polyclonal antibody, R2 (1 : 1000; this antibody was raised in rabbits immunized with a complex antigen consisting of native and denatured mixture of Hsp70/Hsc70), was added, followed by goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA). 3,3\u00a2,5,5\u00a2-tetramethyl-benzidine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA, T-0440) and hydrogen peroxide were used to develop the calorimetric reaction which was stopped after 15 min by the addition of 0.2 M sulfuric acid. The optical density was measured at 450 nm using the Safire plate reader (Tecan, Gro\u00a8dig, Austria) and Hsp70 quantities in samples were determined using the calibration curve (0.50\u2013250 ng/mL) obtained from the titrated standards.The effect of arimoclomol on Hsp70 expression in SODG93A mice",

Motor performance was evaluated twice weekly by a rotarod test (Columbus Instruments, OH, USA), paw grip endurance (PaGE), and an extension reflex of hindlimbs, beginning at 10 weeks of age after a 2-week learning period. The time period that mice remained on a rotarod rotating at a constant speed of 16 rpm was measured, with 300 s chosen as the arbitrarycut-off time. Animals performed three trials for each evaluation, and the longest duration achieved was recorded. PaGE was used to quantify the grip strength of the mouse. The wire lid was gently shaken to prompt the mouse to hold onto the grid before the lid was flipped upside down. The time before the mouse let go of the grid with at least both hindlimbs was measured. Each mouse was allowed three attempts to hold onto the inverted lid for an arbitrary maximum of 200 s, and the longest duration was recorded. The extension reflex was quantified using the following 4-point scoring system: 0 for loss of reflex, with hindlimbs and paws held close to the body; 1 for loss of reflex with marked flexion of the hindlimbs; 2 for hindlimbs extending to <90 degrees with a decreased extension reflex in bilateral hindlimbs; 3 for hindlimbs extending to <90 degrees with decreased extension reflex in unilateral hindlimbs; and 4 for hindlimbs reflexly extending to form an angle of approximately 120 degrees. The body weight of the mice was measured twice weekly. The day of death was defined as when a mouse could no longer roll over within 30 s after being placed on its side on a flat surface.",

Cyproheptadine was administered to neonatal mice from P5 to 11 (Cypro P5-11), through once daily injections (1 or 5 mg/kg body wt ip) or saline vehicle injections (0.1 ml/10 g body wt). Each pup in the litter was given the same drug dose, and care was taken to minimize the disruption of the litter. These cyproheptadine concentrations were chosen because of their clinical relevance (Kilic et al. 2011; Semenova and Ticku 1992; Singh and Goel 2010; Yi et al. 2011). Fluoxetine (Sigma, St. Louis) was administered to neonatal mice from P5 to P11 (Fluox P5-11), adult mice from P30 to end stage  (Fluox P30), or adult mice from P70 to end stage (Fluox P70). In theFluox P5-11 study, fluoxetine was administered through a once-daily  injection (5 or 10 mg/kg body wt ip) or saline vehicle injection (0.1ml/10 g body wt). Again, each pup in the litter was given the same drug dose, and care was taken to minimize the disruption of the litter. For the long-term fluoxetine treatments (Fluox P30 and P70), fluoxetine was delivered in the water with target concentrations of 5 or 10 mg/kg body wt per day. Fluoxetine was added to water bottles for a final concentration of 25 or 50 mg/l (for 5 and 10 mg/kg body wt per day doses, respectively) based on preliminary measurements of average water consumption (5 ml) and average adult weight (22.5 g). The water was replaced weekly to reduce the effects of fluoxetine instability (Binsumait et al. 2001). These fluoxetine concentrations were chosen because of their clinical relevance (Balu et al. 2009; Nunez et al. 2006; Yirmiya et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2000).",

        "text": "Behavioral Testing. Behavioral testing was performed every 5 days between 7 and 10 AM by persons blind to the drug condition and genotype. Testing was started at P35 for the Fluox and Cypro P5-11 and Fluox P30 studies. Testing was started at P50 for mice that began fluoxetine treatment at P70. Near end stage, mice were tested every day or every other day. Weight, tremor, rotarod performance, and end stage were monitored for all mice. Tremor was determined on a five-point scale: 0 (no tremor), 1 (very small amplitude, induced by manually stroking the limb, constrained to 1 or 2 limbs), 2 (medium amplitude, induced or present at rest, constrained to 1 or 2 limbs), 3 (large amplitude, induced or present at rest, spread to 2 limbs), 4 (very large amplitude, present in all limbs). Tremor onset was defined as the first of three consecutive observations where the mouse scored a 1 or higher. Rotarod training occurred on three consecutive days before rotarod testing commenced. During testing, the rotarod was set to 4 rpm and increased 4 rpm every 30 s up to a maximum rotation of 20 rpm at 120 s. The rotarod then maintained a rotational speed of 20 rpm for 60 s, for a total of 180 s. Mice were run three times with a minimum of 5 min between each run. The time of the longest run and the age at which the mice failed to complete the entire protocol (180 s) on all three runs were recorded. End stage was defined as when the mice could no longer maintain themselves on the rotarod for 5 s, about one-third of a turn on the rotarod. This corresponded to gross motor deficits and the inability to maintain body weight. Voluntary locomotion was monitored every 10 days for both neonatal studies (Fluox and Cypro P5-11) and the Fluox P30 study. Each mouse was placed in an empty cage with a 2   3 grid on the bottom. Line crossings were recorded for 3 min to determine whether the drugs altered their general locomotor and exploratory behavior. The cage was cleaned after each mouse. Water consumption was monitored for the Fluox P70 study to determine whether fluoxetine treatment altered drinking behavior (recorded from P50 to P110).",

        "text": "Measurement of Fluoxetine and Its Metabolite Norfluoxetine. A three-step method was devised to measure the fluoxetine and norfluoxetine in mouse brain. Brains were thawed and weighed after transfer into a tared 1.7-ml conical tube. Two volumes (0.6 ml) of extraction buffer (0.01 M ammonium formate, pH 5.0) were added, and the brain was homogenized with a motorized plastic homogenizer (15 s at room temp). The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was saved and the sample homogenized again with 0.6 ml of extraction buffer. After centrifugation, the combined supernatants were applied to a weak cation exchanger (WCX) solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge (Supelco no. 52737U) and allowed to flow under gravity. The flow through was saved for subsequent chromatography on a reversed-phase SPE cartridge. The WCX cartridge was washed with 2 ml of the extraction buffer and then eluted with 2   0.5 ml of 0.25 M ammonium formate pH 3.0. The eluant was concentrated on a Speed Vac to near dryness and then resuspended to a volume of 100 l of 5% methanol. This eluant contains the 5-HT and a small percentage (1\u20132%) of the fluoxetine/ norfluoxetine from the brains of treated mice. The flow through from the WCX cartridge was adjusted to pH 2 with 10% formic acid and applied to a C18 SPE cartridge (Nest Group no. SMMSS18V) that was preequilibrated with 100% acetonitrile followed by 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid-water. After washing with 2 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, the column was eluted with 70% acetonitrile (2   0.5 ml). The eluates were combined and evaporated to dryness on a Speed Vac. The residue was redissolved in 100 l of 10% acetonitrile-water. This eluant contains 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and a small amount (1\u20132%) of norfluoxetine/fluoxetine from the treated mice. The pellet from the original tissue lysate was rehomogenized in 0.8 ml of 90% methanol and centrifuged again. The supernatant was analyzed directly for fluoxetine and norfluoxetine. Samples were analyzed on a HPLC-mass spectrometry system (Agilent 1100) that has an ion-trap mass spectrometer detector. Chromatography was done on a Waters Atlantis T3 column (2.1   150 mm) at a flow rate of 150 l/min. The elution solvents were 10 mM ammonium formate, pH 3.5 (A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (B). The gradient program was 12% B for 2 min followed by a gradient to 62% B in 12 min and hold for 8 min. Detection of the compounds was done with the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method. The parent MH  and transition ions were 5-HT (177\u00a1160), 5-HIAA (192.5\u00a1146), norfluoxetine (296\u00a1134), and fluoxetine (310\u00a1148). Peak areas of the transitions were recorded and the samples compared with standards run with each group of samples. Typically, seven or eight concentrations of standards were used to construct calibration curves that were linear over the measured range. The ion accumulation time was set maximally to 100 ms and the four transitions monitored simultaneously at a scan speed of 4,000 m/z s. Only those transitions that occurred in the standard retention time windows were used for area calculations. Recovery factors were determined by spiking standards into control tissue samples that had been depleted of 5-HT and 5-HIAA. Recovery of 5-HT and 5-HIAA was 80%, while recovery of fluoxetine was 15.9% and that of norfluoxetine was 11.5%. Recovery of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine in the mouse brain was limited by the compound solubility in the extraction solution (90% methanol).Fluox P70: fluoxetine did not alter SOD1G93A disease progression. Fluox P70: fluoxetine did not alter water intake. Fluox P70: fluoxetine was present in the CNS at end stage. Fluox P30: fluoxetine did not alter SOD1G93A disease progression Fluox P30: fluoxetine did not alter gross motor activity. Fluox P5-11: neonatal fluoxetine did not alter disease onset in SOD1G93A mice. Fluox P5-11: neonatal fluoxetine increased the rate of disease progression Fluox P5-11: neonatal fluoxetine affected weight in both SOD1G93A and control animals Fluox P5-11: neonatal fluoxetine did not alter gross motor activity.",

Depolarizing current ramps and steps were used in current-clamp mode to measure firing threshold voltage, action potential properties including overshoot and width at halfpeak, afterhyperpolarization after single action potentials (AHP), the slope of the firing frequency-current relationship, and the current at which firing commences (I-ON) and ceases (I-OFF). Other cell properties including resting potential, input resistance, and sag and rebound potentials (the hallmarks of the IH current) were also recorded in current clamp.

        "text": "Whole cell recordings. Cells were transferred from the incubator to a recording chamber, and residual maintenance medium was washed out with riluzole-free aCSF for a minimum of 15 min before recording started. Selected neurons were large ( 20- m diameter), multipolar, and had triangular cell bodies. Neurons identified by these selection criteria are consistently labeled by SMI-32, peripherin, acetylcholine, choline acetyltransferase, and calcitonin gene-related peptide, all markers of motoneurons in vivo (Carriedo et al. 1995, 1996). These criteria preferentially include large motoneurons while excluding small motoneurons. In the spinal cord, motoneurons are by far the largest neurons in vivo; nevertheless, it is possible that a small percentage of large interneurons are included in the sample. The exact developmental stage of these neurons is not known; however, they are thought to be relatively immature since they have not yet developed the CaPIC present in the late neonatal stage (Quinlan et al. 2011). Recordings were made at room temperature with the Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). In voltageclamp mode, fast, slow, and whole cell capacitance transients were compensated for with the capacitance compensation in Multiclamp. Cells were discarded if the initial action potential (AP) overshoot was less than 20 mV, if the resting membrane potential (RMP) was greater than  40 mV or changed more than 5 mV, if access resistance was greater than 30 M , or if input conductance changed more than 30%.For riluzole to affect the cultured neurons, spontaneous activity must be present in the culture system. Therefore, in a number of experiments, spontaneous firing was recorded in aCSF without synaptic blockers. aCSF with synaptic blockers was used for all subsequent measures. In current-clamp mode, triangular current ramps were used to elicit repetitive firing (10 s total duration) and to produce firing frequency-current (FI) relationships. Depolarizing current steps were also used in some cells to determine the effects on firing behavior when riluzole was added to the aCSF. In voltage-clamp mode, current-voltage (IV) relationships were assessed with very slow triangular voltage ramps (9.4 mV/s) from  90 to  10 mV. At the end of some whole cell recordings (N  2), it was verified that riluzole could be washed out during the initial 15-min washout period at the beginning of the experiment. First, 2  M riluzole was added to the aCSF, and firing was abolished or decreased to steady levels. The riluzole was then washed out of the recording chamber with normal aCSF, and the time until normal firing returned was recorded.",

Daily intraperitoneal administration of vehicle (saline) or edaravone (15 mg/kg/day) was initiated at 91 days of age, over a period of 28 days (28 injections in total). The two groups were used to assess clinical scores and survival rates, and in vivo optical imaging of oxidative stress along with Nrf2 single Tg mice.

These analyses were started at 84 days of age (pre\u2010 symptomatic stage) in Nrf2/G93A mice treated with vehicle or edaravone according to our previous reports (Ohta et al., 2008, 2006, 2016). In the rotarod test, three trials were performed and the best result was recorded. End\u2010stage was defined as the time at which a mouse could not right itself within 30 s when placed on its side. In vivo bioluminescent imaging was performed in Nrf2 mice and Nrf2/G93A mice treated with vehicle or edaravone using the IVIS spectrum imaging system (PerkinElmer Inc., Billerica, MA, USA). At 84, 105 (early symptomatic stage) and 126 (late stage) days of age (each n = 6\u201312), mice were intraperitoneally injected with 300 mg/ kg of D\u2010luciferin (OZ Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) dissolved in phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS) 15 min before in vivo optical im\u2010 aging. Under constant anesthesia, the skin of back and lower limbs (LL) was then opened to show the vertebrae and muscles of LL. In the preliminary experiment, mice died too early after laminectomy to detect direct bioluminescent signals from the spinal cords (data not shown). Therefore, we analyzed bioluminescent signals of spi\u2010 nal cords through vertebrae at a 3\u2010min exposure time after incision. In vivo optical signals of oxidative stress in Nrf2/G93A mice were observed as bioluminescence of exogenous human Nrf2 fragment combined with flag\u2010tagged luciferase, induced by endogenous Nrf2 dissociated from Keap1 (Oikawa et al., 2012). Bioluminescent sig\u2010 nals of the spinal cords and bilateral LL were measured using regions of interest (ROIs), and emission intensity was expressed as the total flux of photons (photons/s) by LivingImage software (PerkinElmer) (Nakano et al., 2017).",

Identical exposure and gain settings were used to capture the images, and the negative controls without primary antibodies produced no staining. Misfolded SOD1 aggregates were counted from at least 20 motor neurons per mouse with 5 mice per treatment group. LC3-positive APs and LAMP2-positive lysosomes were counted from at least 10 motor neurons per mouse and averaged with n=3 mice per treatment group. Analysis of TOMM20 staining was performed using ImageJ software. Images were converted to grayscale and the area above threshold was determined. The same threshold brightness level was used for all images. Ten images per mouse were analyzed with 4 mice per genotype. Image analysis was restricted to nuclear RBFOX3/NeuN-positive motor neurons only.Rilmenidine enhances macroautophagy and clears mutant SOD1 protein from NSC-34 cells",

        "text": "Determination of symptom onset, randomization and drug treatment of G93A mice. Symptom onset was assessed by blinded observation of changes in hind limb gait; these changes are related to the mouse\u2019s inability to support its weight on its hind limbs. At onset, mice initially place their weight on the toes and then quickly fall to full foot placement (as opposed to healthy mice which walk and run on the hind toes); this \u2018toe-to-heel\u2019 walking pattern produces an asymmetric gait between hind and fore limbs and a characteristic \u2018wobbling\u2019 gait. Mouse groups were randomized based on symptom onset and alternately placed in control and treated groups, e.g., the first mouse to develop hind limb weakness was placed in the control group, the second was injected with test compound and placed in the treatment group, and so on. The net effect of this type of randomization was to create groups with mean onset ages which are virtually identical, thereby allowing the use of smaller numbers of mice (typically 10\u2013 13 per group) and still maintain sufficient statistical power. By definition, the onset administration paradigm employed was focused on what we term the \u2018survival interval\u2019 \u2013 namely the time from onset to end-stage killing. Because both drug- and vehicle-treated groups were derived from the same groups of age-matched mice, survival results were properly normalized by comparing survival intervals of drug-treated to survival intervals of vehicle-treated groups to determine survival interval ratios (SIRs). All drugs and vehicle were administered once daily by the i.p. route beginning on the first day of symptom onset. AM-1241 and WIN-55,212 have very poor water solubility and require a vehicle which is both capable of dissolving the drug and is biocompatible (with chronic dosing). Other groups have used complex vehicles composed of polyethoxylated vegetable oils and/or ethanol/glycerol/ water mixtures. We tested a number of traditional vehicles such as ethanol/water, glycerol, polyethylene glycol, and high purity olive oil. Stable dissolution of AM-1241 and WIN-55,212 was achieved only with olive oil, and thus it was selected as the vehicle for these studies. Two different concentrations of AM-1241 (1 and 0.1 mg/ mL) and one WIN-55,212 concentration (1 mg/mL) were prepared in order to minimize the volume of olive oil that was injected i.p",

To identify CB1 and CB2 receptors, each sample containing 100 lg of spinal cord membrane protein was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide mini-gels. Prior to separation, samples were resuspended in 40 lL of electrophoresis loading buffer (0.065 mol/L Tris\u2013HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol), and heated at 90C for 2 min. The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method of immunoblotting was employed (GE Healthcare/ Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Gels were transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes and incubated overnight at 4C with 10% milk in blotting buffer (TBS-0.1%) (Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.6, 25 mmol/L; NaCl, 0.09%; Tween-20, 0.1%). Blots were then washed three times (5 min each) with TBS-0.1% and incubated with primary antibodies (1 : 200) overnight at 4C while shaking. For selected blots, the appropriate blocking peptide (1 : 100) was incubated with the respective primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature (25C) prior to incubation with blots. The primary antibody solutions were removed and blots washed as described previously. Secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase, 1 : 5000) was added and incubated for 4 h, with shaking. The secondary antibody was removed and blots washed as described. Blots were incubated for 1 min with equal volumes of ECL detection reagents 1 and 2. Chemiluminescence was captured for 2 h and saved as a TIFF file by a Flurochem 8900 MultiImage Light Cabinet (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA, USA). The captured images were digitized and the relative cannabinoid receptor levels compared after densitometry analysis (Scion NIH Image 1.63, NIH Freeware, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The relative protein levels were calculated by normalizing to actin immunoreactivity and subtracting the background intensity. The primary antibodies and blocking peptides for both the CB1 and CB2 receptors were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The CB1 receptor polyclonal antibody (Catalog No. 10006590) was raised against the C-terminal amino acids 461\u2013 472 of the human CB1 receptor. This antigen is identical to the corresponding sequence in murine, rat, canine and bovine species. The CB2 receptor polyclonal antibody (Catalog No. 101550) was raised against amino acids 20\u201333 in a sequence between the Nterminus and the first transmembrane domain of the protein of the human CB2 receptor. Human and murine CB2 receptors exhibit 82% homology at the amino acid level over the complete protein. CB1 (Catalog No. 10006591) and CB2 (Catalog No. 301550) blocking peptides were derived from the CB1 and CB2 receptor sequences used as antigens for production of the respective polyclonal antiserum.",

[3 H]CP-55,940 (180 Ci/ mmol, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Wellesley, MA, USA) binds with equivalent affinity to CB1 and CB2 receptors with an approximate Ki of 0.5 nmol/L (Shoemaker et al. 2005).

        "text": "[35S]GTPcS binding. [35S]GTPcS binding assays were performed as described previously (Prather et al. 2000a) in a buffer containing 20 mmol/L Hepes, 100 mmol/L NaCl, and 10 mmol/L MgCl2 at pH 7.4. Each binding reaction contained 10 lg of spinal cord membrane protein, the presence or absence of cannabinoid ligands (see the following), plus 0.1 nmol/L [35S]GTPcS (1250 Ci/mmol, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences) and 10 lmol/L of GDP to suppress basal Gprotein activation. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 30C. Nonspecific binding was defined by binding observed in the presence of 10 lmol/L of non-radioactive GTPcS. The reaction was terminated by rapid vacuum filtration through glass fiber filters followed by two washes with ice-cold assay buffer. About 4 mL of Scintiverse (Fisher Scientific) was added to the filters and radioactivity quantified by scintillation counting. Cannabinoid-mediated G-protein activation in spinal cord membranes was measured by selective antagonism of the [35S]GTPcS binding produced by a receptor-saturating concentration (100 nmol/ L) of the full, non-selective CB1/CB2 agonist HU-210. HU-210 binds with equivalent affinity to CB1 and CB2 receptors with an approximate Ki of 0.5 nmol/L (Felder et al. 1995; Breivogel et al. 2001). In these studies, we first determined the minimal concentration of the neutral CB1 antagonist O-2050 (Gardner and Mallet 2006) required to completely block CB1-mediated G-protein activation by HU-210. This was accomplished by antagonism experiments employing membranes prepared from mouse cortex as a relatively pure source of CB1 receptors. In these studies, it was determined that 3 lmol/L of O-2050 was the minimal concentration required to completely block HU-210-mediated (100 nmol/L) Gprotein activation by CB1 receptors in cortical membranes (data not shown). Next, the minimal concentration of the selective CB2 antagonist SR-144528 (Rinaldi-Carmona et al. 1998) required to completely block CB2-mediated G-protein activation by HU-210 was determined. This was accomplished by antagonism experiments employing membranes prepared from CHO\u2013CB2 cells (Shoemaker et al. 2005) as a pure source of CB2 receptors. In these studies, it was shown that 3 lmol/L of SR-144528 was the minimal concentration required to completely block HU-210-mediated (100 nmol/L) G-protein activation by CB2 receptors in CHO\u2013CB2 membranes (data not shown). Therefore, employing spinal cord membranes harvested from WT-OE and G93A mice, CB1-selective stimulation was defined as the amount of O-2050 (3 lmol/L) sensitive G-protein stimulation produced by HU-210 (100 nmol/L). CB2-selective activation was defined as the amount of SR-144528 (3 lmol/L) sensitive G-protein stimulation produced by HU-210 (100 nmol/L). The selective antagonism method described here was developed in response to many failed attempts to demonstrate consistent, measurable G-protein activation with the selective CB1 agonist ACEA (Hillard et al. 1999) or the CB2 agonists GW-405833 (Valenzano et al. 2005) and AM-1241 (Yao et al. 2006) in mouse spinal cord membranes (data not shown). While these observations were surprising for the full CB1 agonist ACEA (Hillard et al. 1999), both GW-405833 and AM-1241 have been reported to act as partial agonists in several in vitro assays (Valenzano et al. 2005; Yao et al. 2006). In any case, it is likely that the poor G-protein stimulation produced by partial agonists in the present study is due to less than optimal experimental conditions and/or a relatively low density of cannabinoid receptors expressed in spinal cord membranes, leading to reduced receptor-mediated responses.",

Briefly, the dorsal horns of spinal cords were dissected and incubated in 0.05% trypsin for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C, followed by mechanical dissociation. Motor neurons were then purified by centrifugation on an Optiprep cushion, followed by isolation of p75NTR expressing motor neurons by immunoaffinity selection with the IgG 192 monoclonal antibody. Motor neuron cultures were plated at a density of 300 cells/cm2 in 24 well plates precoated with polyornithine and laminin and maintained in Neurobasal media supplemented with 2% horse serum, 25 \u03bcM Lglutamate, 25 \u03bcM 2-mercaptoethanol, 500 \u03bcM L-glutamine, and 2% B27 supplement at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere (Cassina et al., 2002; Henderson et al., 1995).

Apocynin was added to warm sterile water, about 60\u00b0C, at a concentration of 1mg/ml, 2 mg/ml or 5 mg/ml and stirred. Treatment water was allowed to cool to room temperature before administered to mice. When indicated, apocynin was alternately prepared, method B, by its addition to sterile water and heated to 60\u00b0C while stirred, then cooled to room temperature. A concentration of 1 mg/ml translates to a dose of about 150 mg/kg/day, 2 mg/ml about 300 mg/kg/day and 5 mg/ml about 750 mg/kg/day based on an average ALS mouse, weighing between 25-30 grams, consumes on average 4 ml water/day (Bachmanov et al., 2002). Treatment was administered at 21 or 100 days of age to littermate matched control ALS mice. Apocynin-antibiotic treatment was prepared by adding 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin and 0.1 mg/ml ceftazidime to the cooled apocynin treatment water. For this treatment group of mice, animals were switched from regular apocynin water to apocynin-antibiotic water at 100 days of age. The same concentration of antibiotics were added to sterile water and administered at 100 days of age to the littermate matched control mice for this group. Diapocynin requires dilute buffering to dissolve in water therefore at a concentration of 1 mg/ml diapocynin was added to sterile water and dissolved by increasing to pH \u223c10 with 1M NaOH. Once fully dissolved, 1M HCl was added to the solution until pH 7.6-7.8, for a concentration of 10 mM saline in the diapocynin treatment. Control treatment for littermate matched mice was prepared by making a 10 mM saline solution with the same pH as diapocynin treatment. Diapocynin treatment, which translates to a dosage of 150 mg/kg/day, or saline treatment was administered at 21 days or 100 days of age to littermate matched control mice. Vanillic acid treatment was prepared by adding 0.5 mg/ml or 1 mg/ml to sterile water and heated to 60\u00b0C. Once dissolved, it was allowed to cool to room temperature before administered to littermate matched control mice. A concentration of 0.5 mg/ml translates to a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day and 1 mg/ml to 150 mg/kg/day. Treatment water was replaced weekly.

Motor neuron survival was evaluated by Nissl staining. The absolute numbers of motor neurons with visible nucleoli were counted in the ventral horns of all sections from lumbar regions at the L2\u20133 level. The observer was blinded to the identity of each preparation. The numbers reported for each experimental group were average counts of motor neurons per section (including right and left ventral horns) among 20 continuous sections from each of five animals. The area of grey and white matter and the total cross-sectional area were also measured in the same Nissl-stained preparations of lumbar spinal cord using Spot RT Software (Diagnostic Instrument, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Subsequently, the volume per section was calculated as area \u00d7 thickness. An average volume per section was calculated for mice in each experimental group. In parallel experiments, serial sections of spinal cord were immunostained with antibodies specifically against cytochrome c (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA), activated caspase-3 (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), Ricinus communis agglutinin-1 (RCA-1, Sigma), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), or MT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, CA) respectively followed by conjugated secondary antibody as previously described (Ferrante et al., 1997; Ryu et al., 2005).",

Briefly, for the samples of total protein lysates, tissue samples (mouse or human spinal cord specimens) were homogenized on ice in RIPA buffer (1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 142.5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and PMSF (0.1 mg/ml; Fluka, Switzerland). Lysates were centrifuged twice at 10,000 \u00d7g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. The resulting supernatants were analyzed by western blotting with antibodies to caspase-1, caspase-3, caspase-9, Rip2, MT1 and MT2. To prepare cytosolic fractions, tissue samples were gently homogenized in cold buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitor cocktail and 0.1 mg/ml PMSF) and clarified by a 700 \u00d7g centrifugation for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.

The spinal cords were dissected carefully, and the lumbar segment was identified using the ribs and the vertebrae as a guide. Tissues were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 6 h. Blocks were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 24 h. For stereological analysis, serial coronal sections (50 \u03bcm thick) were cut through the lumbar (L1\u2013L4) spinal cord enlargements from wild-type controls and vehicle-, lenalidomide-treated G93A mice and stained for Nissl substance using cresyl violet as described previously (n= 6) (Kiaei et al., 2005a). The optical fractionator method in the Stereo Investigator (v3.45) software program (Microbrightfield, Burlington, VT) was employed to obtain unbiased stereological counts of Nissl-stained neurons in the ventral horn of 10 serial non-adjacent sections (250 \u03bcm apart). Cell counts were made bilaterally within an area demarcated by a horizontal line drawn through the central canal and encompassing the ventral gray horn of the gray matter to include layers seven through nine. The size of the x-y sampling grid was 200 \u03bcm \u00d7 200 \u03bcm. The counting frame thickness was 14 \u03bcm with 3-\u03bcm guard zones. Neuronal counts are expressed as the means\u00b1 standard errors of the mean. A separate set of sections was collected as free-floating sections and processed for immunohistochemistry. The sections were immunostained with antibodies to TNF- (Peprotech, NJ), FasL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), CD40 (Serotec, Oxford, UK), and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP; Dako, Carpinteria, CA), using a modified avidin\u2013biotin\u2013peroxidase technique. The immuno reaction was visualized using 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride dihydrate with nickel intensification (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as the chromogen. The sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides, dehydrated, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped. The specificity of immunostaining was confirmed by omission of the primary antibody.",

        "text": "Quantitative Histopathological Investigation at the Disease Endpoint. All G1H-G93A mice in the experimental groups treated with drugs or placebo were killed for quantitative histopathological evaluation for humane reasons when they became moribund (before they had succumbed to respiratory failure). Wild-type littermates given placebo were sacrificed at the age of 145 days. Each animal was fully anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium at a dose of 1 ml per kg of body weight. Laparotomy and thoracotomy were performed and blood was removed by perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) via the left ventricle and aorta. Next, perfusion was performed with a fixative of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) at room temperature. The spinal cord was removed and re-fixed in the same fixative for 18 hours at room temperature. Two segments of the cervical cord (upper and lower cervical segments), 3 segments of the thoracic cord (upper, middle, and lower thoracic segments), and 2 segments of the lumbar cord (upper and lower lumbar segments) were harvested (7 segments in total). They were each embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 lm using a microtome. These sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Klu\u00a8verBarrera (KB) stains. For quantitative analysis, 25 serial 5 lm sections were cut from each segment, and the 1st section, 7th section, 13th section, 19th section, and 25th section were subjected to H&E staining. The 2nd section, 8th section, 14th section, and 20th section were subjected to KB staining. These sections were selected so that there was a 25-lm-interval between each pair. To calculate the number of motor neurons in the anterior horns, all of the H&E-stained sections were observed under a light microscope (BX41: Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 3CCD digital color camera system (FX380: Olympus Corp.). Photographs of the anterior horn region (corresponding to Rexed areas VII, VIII, and IX) (25) in each stained section were taken and the images were analyzed using image analysis software (FLVFS-LS Ver. 1.12: Olympus Corp.). Anterior horn cells were defined as cells that had a cell body with a diameter of 25 lm or more (26\u201329). Based on this definition, the number of anterior horn cells was counted in each of the H&E-stained sections. The total numbers of anterior horn cells in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord segments of each mouse were calculated. For the cervical segments, the total number of anterior horn cells was determined as the sum of the number of cells in each of the 10 H&Estained sections from the 2 different cervical cord segments, and the number of anterior horn cells per 5 sections was calculated. For the thoracic segments, the total number of anterior horn cells was determined as the sum of the number of cells in each of the 15 sections from the 3 different areas of the thoracic spinal cord, and the number of anterior horn cells per 5 sections was calculated. Likewise, for lumbar segments, the total number of anterior horn cells was determined as the sum of the number of cells in each of the 10 sections from the 2 different lumbar spinal cord segments, and the number of anterior horn cells per 5 sections was calculated.",

Reactions were incubated for 4 min at room temperature and then terminated by filtration using a Packard Filtermate 96-well harvester, followed by rapid washing with ice-cold Na -free HBS (prepared by equimolar replacement with choline).

Briefly, mice were placed on top of a standard wire cage lid which was suspended a few inches above the bench top. Mice were briefly allowed to acclimate before the cage lid was smoothly inverted to prompt the mouse to grip the wire with both its fore and hind limbs. A stopwatch was started as soon as the cage lid was inverted and the time was measured to determine how long the mouse could hold on before its hind legs released their grip from the cage lid, expressed as latency to fall. Care was taken not to jostle the lid during this time. The stopwatch was stopped at a maximum of 30s. Mice were given five scored attempts and the highest and lowest scores were excluded from the final score. Final scores are reported as an average of the three remaining scored attempts \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) for each time point. Time points correspond to the age of the animal at the time that testing was performed and are reported as a range of several days since multiple sets of animals having slightly different ages were tested concomitantly. Motor function and endurance were assessed by accelerating rotarod testing once per week beginning at disease onset. Mice were placed on a rod, 30 mm in diameter, rotating at 4 rpm. Each animal was placed in one lane and subjected to three trials. The lane was cleaned before the next mouse was tested to prevent interference. Once the mice were acclimated to the initial speed of 4 rpm, the rod was accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm over the course of 5 min. The time was stopped when the mouse fell off the rotating rod, expressed as latency to fall. Mice were given three scored attempts reported as an average \u00b1 SEM for each time point. Time points correspond to the age of the animal at the time that testing was performed and are reported as a range of several days since multiple sets of animals having slightly different ages were tested concomitantly.",

Stained for Iba-1 and GFAP at End Stage of the Untreated hSOD1G93A Littermate Mouse Tissue was imaged using a Zeiss Axio Observer epifluorescence microscope to capture a single image of each ventral horn on the 20\u00d7 objective. Imaging was performed by blinded researchers. For Iba-1 and GFAP, images were captured on the Alexa Fluor 488 channel and the exposure time was set appropriately for the untreated hSOD1G93A littermate and kept constant when imaging the PCAtreated hSOD1G93A and WT littermate mice. At least 6 ventral horns per animal were imaged and analyzed for fluorescence intensity using Adobe Photoshop CC software for both Iba-1 and GFAP staining. For both Iba-1 and GFAP quantification, the ventral horn image of the untreated hSOD1G93A littermate control mouse with the most background was chosen, and the green channel input level was adjusted so that background staining was best eliminated. This value was recorded and used for each subsequent image, including those taken from the WT control littermate and the PCA-treated hSOD1G93A littermate mice such that all images were adjusted by an equivalent amount. After the channel levels were adjusted, the ventral horn was outlined using the lasso tool and green channel values for mean pixel intensity and pixel area were recorded for each ventral horn image. Total pixel intensity of the green channel was obtained by multiplying the pixel intensity and pixel area. An average of the total pixel intensity was taken for each mouse. Quantification was performed twice by two different and blinded researchers. An average of the pixel intensities for each mouse was obtained. For analysis, the average total pixel intensity for the WT littermate control mouse for each group was set at 100% and the average total pixel intensities for the untreated hSOD1G93A littermate control and PCA-treated hSOD1G93A littermate mice were calculated as percentages relative to the WT littermate control mouse.

Imaging was performed by blinded researchers. Images were captured on the Alexa Fluor 488 channel (pseudo-colored red) and the exposure time was set appropriately for the untreated hSOD1G93A littermate and kept constant when imaging the PCA-treated hSOD1G93A and WT littermate mice. Two littermate groups were analyzed and 6 ventral horns per animal were imaged and analyzed for fluorescence intensity using Adobe Photoshop CC software. The ventral horn image of the untreated hSOD1G93A littermate control mouse with the most background was chosen, and the red channel input level was adjusted so that background staining was best eliminated. This value was recorded and used for each subsequent image, including those taken from the WT control littermate and the PCA-treated hSOD1G93A littermate mice such that all images were adjusted by an equivalent amount. After the channel levels were adjusted, the ventral horn was outlined using the lasso tool and red channel values for mean pixel intensity and pixel area were recorded for each ventral horn image. Total pixel intensity of the red channel was obtained by multiplying the pixel intensity and pixel area. An average of the total pixel intensity was taken for each mouse. Quantification was performed once by a blinded researcher. An average of the pixel intensities for each mouse was obtained. For analysis, the average total pixel intensity for the WT littermate control mouse for each group was set at 100% and each individual total pixel intensity for each ventral horn for the untreated hSOD1G93A littermate control and PCA-treated hSOD1G93A littermate mice were calculated as percentages relative to the average total pixel intensity of the WT littermate control mouse. Mean raw 4-HNE fluorescence intensity in the lumbar spinal cord ventral horn in the untreated hSOD1G93A littermate mice and WT littermate mice were also counted and statistically compared to verify a significant disease effect.",

        "text": "Motor unit assessment via in vivo electrophysiology. This method is routinely performed in our laboratory and has been previously described [23,28]. Mice were deeply anesthetized via intra peritoneal injection of fentanyl/fluanisone (Hypnorm, Vetapharma Ltd.), midazolam (Hypnovel, Roche) and water (1:1:2 by volume) at a dosage of 9 ml/kg. Careful monitoring of mice was performed throughout the experiment and additional doses of anaesthetic were administered as required to ensure that there was no reflex response to toe pinch. The distal tendons of the right TA and EDL muscles were dissected free from surrounding tissue, individually tied with 4.0 braided surgical silk (Interfocus) and cut at their distal ends. The sciatic nerve was then exposed and all its branches cut except the common peroneal nerve (CPN), which innervates the TA and EDL muscles. The mouse was placed on a thermopad (Harvard Apparatus) to maintain body temperature at 37uC. The right foot was secured to a platform and the knee immobilized using a stainless steel pin. The TA and EDL muscle tendons were then individually attached to a strain gauge (Dynamometer, UFI Devices) to record muscle twitch forces. Isometric twitch contractions were elicited by stimulating the distal part of the DPN via bipolar silver electrodes using square wave pulses of 0.02 ms. Force output from the strain gauge was recorded using an analogue to digital converter interfaced with a computer running the appropriate software (Cambridge Electronics Design Ltd). The stimulation voltage and subsequently the length of the muscle were adjusted to produce the maximum isometric twitch force. The stimulus amplitude was then set to 0 V and manually increased over a range of 10 V, which resulted in discrete increments in twitch force due to the successive recruitment of motor units. With each increment in force, the stimulus amplitude was held at constant voltage for at least 5 stimuli and then increased manually until a larger twitch was generated. This procedure was repeated until there was no further increase in force, indicating that all motor units were recruited. The number of step-wise increments of force was counted for both control and metformin-treated mice in a blinded fashion and taken as an estimate of the number of motor units in the TA and EDL muscles.",

        "text": " Analysis of disease progression and survival. Neurological scores for both hind limbs were assessed twice weekly for each mouse from 41 days of age. Neurological scores were assigned using a scale of 0\u20134 developed by the ALSTDI through detailed observations of SOD1G93A mouse pathology [22,29,30]. Criteria used to assign each score level were: 0 - Full extension of hind legs away from lateral midline when mouse is suspended by its tail and mouse can hold this for 2 seconds, suspended 2\u20133 times. 1 - Collapse or partial collapse of leg extension towards lateral midline (weakness) or trembling of hind legs during tail suspension. 2 - Toes curl under at least twice during walking of 12 inches or any part of foot is dragging along cage bottom (a clean cage containing no bedding was used for this analysis to permit easy viewing of the toes). 3 - Rigid paralysis or minimal joint movement, foot not being used for forward motion. 4 - Mouse cannot right itself within 30 s from one or both of its sides (this test was performed in a clean cage containing the same type and amount of bedding as present in the mouse\u2019s home cage). Body weight for all mice was measured twice weekly from 35 days of age. This provided an additional, non-invasive, measure of disease onset and progression and also allowed monitoring of the general health of the mice. Weight-loss in high copy SOD1G93A mice is normally a gradual process that begins at approximately 90 days of age and continues until death. Rapid losses of weight over a short number of days that do not fit the normal pattern can therefore be indicative of non-ALS related or drug-induced maladies [22]. For humane reasons, a uniform end point of the inability of a mouse to right itself within 30 s of being placed on a side (neurological score 4) was employed for all mice. From 100 days of age, the righting reflex of each mouse from each side was tested twice daily to ensure that the end point of each mouse was accurately determined. Once mice reached their end point, they were euthanized via cervical dislocation and the date and cause of their death was recorded.",

Analysis of Z-stacks by confocal microscopy was performed in three to four axonal projections per animal. The axonal length to the first branching (UAL) was determined by tracing the labeled axon from the spinal cord to the point where it branches using ImageJ (NIH).

Fluorescence was observed under a 488 nm wavelength excitation. The generation of reactive oxygen species in the larvae exposed to the chemicals was also quantitatively assessed as described elsewhere [35]. Briefly, 15 embryos were washed with cold Phosphate Buffer solution (PBS; pH 7.4) twice and then homogenized in cold buffer (0.32 mM of sucrose, 20 mM of HEPES, 1 mM of MgCl2, and 0.5 mM of phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride (PMSF), pH 7.4).

Twenty microliters of the homogenate was added to a 96- well plate and incubated at room temperature for 5 min, after which 100 ml of PBS (pH 7.4) and 8.3 ml of DFH stock solution (10 mg/ml) were added to each well. The plate was incubated at 37uC for 30 minutes.

A parallel group of female G93A rats untreated (n = 5) and treated (n = 5) with 30 mM tempol in the drinking water and wildtype littermates (n = 5) was used for the stereological analysis of spinal cords. At the middle symptomatic phase of the G93A rats (115\u2013120 days), the animals were anesthetized with ketamine (20 mg/kg) and xylazine (1.5 mg/kg) and the euthanasia conducted with an overdose of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg). The animals were perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 2% heparin and 0.1% sodium nitrite followed by fixative solution of 4% formaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS. The lumbar spinal cords (L1\u2013L6) were identified, removed en bloc and its length measured using a digital pachymeter (Digimess). Subsequently, lumbar spinal cords were immersed in the same fixative solution for at least 72 hs, embedded in a 10% agar solution and sectioned with a nominal thickness of 40 mm using a VT1000S Leica vibratome. The sections were stained with 1% toluidine blue or used for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry [35]. Lumbar spinal cord vibrosections for immunohistochemistry were washed with PBS, incubated with a 0.3% Triton X-100 solution, exposed to 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in distilled water to block endogenous peroxidases, placed in a 10% non-immune normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs), incubated with a primary antibody (rabbit anti-ChAT, 1:1000, Abcam) and with a secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate, 1:200, KPL) in PBS. Immunoreactivity was visualised with 3,39- diaminobenzidine in PBS containing 0.01% hydrogen peroxide. Routine immunolabelling controls were carried out by omitting the primary or secondary antibody steps, independently (for more details, see [36]). Stained and immunolabelled sections were collected onto glass, washed in PBS, dehydrated in progressive ethanol concentrations and mounted under a coverslip with a drop of DPX (Fluka). Section images were acquired using a DMR Leica microscope equipped with a High-End DP 72 Olympus digital camera and projected onto a flat computer monitor. Stereological analyses were performed using the optical-disector and the rotator procedures of the newCAST Visiopharm stereology system version 4.2.8.0.",

        "text": "Stereological analysis of spinal cords. The total volumes of white and grey matter, ventral horn and lumbar spinal cord were estimated by means of the Cavalieri principle [37,38] in the same reference sections stained with toluidine blue used for disectors. Section profile areas were estimated from the numbers of randomly-positioned test points (,200 per compartment: white matter, grey matter and ventral horn) hitting the whole reference space and the areal equivalent of a test point. The total volumes of each compartment were obtained using the following formula V : = T. gACOMP, where T is the between-section distance (2,200 mm) and gACOMP is the sum of the delineated profile areas of the chosen set of lumbar spinal cord compartments\u2019 sections. The volume of lumbar spinal cord was calculated by the summing the volumes of white matter and grey matter. Irrespective of groups, the mean volume shrinkage (coefficient of variation, CV, expressed as a decimal fraction of the mean) was estimated to be 2.9% (0.19) in the wildtype group, 2.1% (0.15) in the untreated G93A group and 2.2% (0.16) in the treated G93A group. No correction for global shrinkage was performed since between-group differences were not significant (p = 0.21). The optical fractionator was used for estimating the total number of toluidine blue-stained (NTB) and ChAT positive (NChAT) neurons in spinal cord ventral horn [35,39,40]. Before starting the counting procedure, a z-axis distribution (calibration) was performed to determine the neuron distribution throughout section thickness and establish the disector height, which was 15 mm in the wild-type, 20 mm in the G93A untreated and treated group for both toluidine blue-stained and ChAT-positive neurons. Section thickness was measured in every field of view using the central point on the unbiased counting frame. The mean height sampling fraction (hsf) was 3/8 for toluidine blue-stained and for ChAT-positive neurons in the wildtype group and 1/2 for toluidine blue-stained and for ChATpositive neurons in the untreated and treated G93A group. The perikaryon was defined as the counting unit. For all groups, a mean area sampling fraction (asf) of 1/7 for toluidine blue-stained and 1/6 for ChAT-positive neurons of the chosen sections was sampled using 2-D unbiased counting frames with a frame area equivalent to 10,000 mm2 [41]. For toluidine blue-stained neurons an average of 125 disectors were used to count 194 neurons (gQ2) in the wild-type group. In the untreated G93A group, 113 disectors were applied to count 124 neurons and, in the treated G93A group, 115 disectors were applied to count 219 neurons. For ChAT-positive neurons an average of 97 disectors were used to count 187 neurons (gQ2) in the wild-type group. In the untreated G93A group, 119 disectors were applied to count 107 neurons and, in the treated G93A group, 153 disectors were applied to count 234 neurons. The total number of toluidine bluestained and ChAT-positive neurons was then estimated by multiplying the counted number of particles - neurons in this case - by the reciprocal of sampling fractions: NTB or ChAT: = ssf 21 . hsf 21. asf 21. SQ2, where ssf is the mean section sampling fraction, hsf is the mean height sampling fraction, asf is the mean area sampling fraction and SQ2 is the total number of particles counted using optical disectors. The mean neuronal volume of toluidine blue-stained and ChAT-positive neurons was estimated by the planar rotator [35,38,42], which is a local and direct estimator of particle volume. The planar rotator method was computer assisted using the 6 half-line rotator probe available in the new CAST Visiopharm stereology system (version 4.2.8.0) and in the same reference sections used for total number estimation.",

The animals traverse the beam in order to reach a dark enclosed escapebox placed on a platform. Each mouse was tested on 3 different beams of decreasing diameter and increasing difficulty (large24 mm, medium 19 mm, and small 11 mm).Between 11\u201313 weeks of age, all mice were trained using the largest beam. Each mouse was first placed in the escape box forabout 1 minute, then placed at the start end of the beam. Micehave a natural tendency to run upwards along the beam toward the escape box. Mice were given 8 trials over 2 days (4 consecutivetrials/day) with a maximum latency of 3 minutes. If an animalpaused on the beam or tried to turn and advance the wrong way, itwas gently touched on the hindquarters or tail and encouraged tokeep moving toward the escape box, or it was placed back at thebeginning and allowed to start the trial again. Between eachanimal, the beam was thoroughly cleaned with soap and waterfollowed by 70% isopropanol.At 17 weeks of age, all mice were assessed on the balance beamin a single test session consisting of 3 consecutive trials on each ofthe 3 different sized beams. The latency to reach the escape boxwas recorded, along with the number of missteps (foot slipping offthe beam). Mice were not allowed to start a trial over. If they felloff the beam, the timer was paused and they were replaced on thebeam at the position where they had fallen. At least one fall on one beam occurred for n =27 vehicle mice and n =22 erlotinib mice.If a mouse paused for over 20 s it was encouraged to keep movingby a gentle touch on the tail or the hindquarters. The experimentwas video recorded. Scoring was done live by one experimenterand also post-hoc by another experimenter using the videorecording. Both experimenters were blind to treatment.

Female 129SvSOD1G93A mice were treated by oral gavage with ubiquinone10 orubiquinol10 (800mg/kg), or vehicle (n =15 each group). Thetreatment started when the mice were 13 weeks old, which is themean age that the growth of their body weight starts to differentiate from that of non-transgenic littermates and theyshow first alterations of hindlimbs abduction when raised by tail.This occurs just before the appearance of motor impairments(onset of motor deficit). Mice were treated daily until the end-stageof the disease, when they were sacrificed (see below).Disease progression was assessed two times a week from the startof the experiment by an operator blinded to the treatment. Theparameters included body weight, latency on rotating bar (rotarod)and paw grip endurance (PaGE) and were evaluated as previouslydescribed [17]. The motor symptoms onset was determined by thefirst impairment in grip strength or on rotarod performance for two consecutive time points. The mice were sacrificed when theywere unable to right themselves within 10 seconds after beingplaced on both sides. This time point was considered as the endstageof the disease and was used to estimate the survival time.Statistical analysis of the data of body weight, grip strength androtarod performance was carried out by Two-way ANOVA forrepeated measures (time) and different groups (treatments),followed by post-hoc Bonferroni\u2019s test to compare the effect of treatments in respect to vehicle at each time point. The analysiswas applied at the time points when all animals for each groupwere still alive in order to maintain the number per groupbalanced. The age at onset and the survival length werestatistically evaluated by the Log-rank test to compare probabilities.",

In situ muscle testing in a cohort of female mice occurred at twostages of disease: at 90\u2013100 days of age, when signs of weaknesswere becoming apparent (weakness and trembling of hindlimbs)and a later stage, 110\u2013115 days where signs of single or dual limbparalysis were evident. Mice were placed under anesthesia usingisoflurane and the skin around the experimental leg was removed.The distal end of the EDL muscle and its associated tendon werethen isolated. The mouse was placed on the platform of an Aurorain situ muscle analysis apparatus (model 806C; Aurora Scientific,Inc., Aurora, Ontario, Canada). Body temperature was maintainedwith a circulating water system. The knee was immobilizedin a clamp between two sharpened screws and the distal tendonwas cut and tied to the arm of a force transducer (AuroraScientific, Ontario, Canada) using a silk suture. The muscle wasstimulated via the peroneal nerve. For nerve isolation, a 0.5 cmincision was made at the upper thigh and the overlying bicepsfemoris muscle was cut to expose the peroneal nerve. The nervewas then dissected free of surrounding connective tissue and a pairof stainless steel needle electrodes (0.10 mm) were placed on theexposed nerve.Muscle contractile properties were assessed by recording theforce generated following stimulation of the peroneal nerve.Muscle length (Lo) was adjusted to produce the maximumisometric force after sub-maximal stimulation (30 Hz, 1 ms pulses,350 ms train duration). Once Lo had been established, the nervewas stimulated every 2 minutes at a selected frequency rangingfrom 10\u2013200 Hz (1 ms pulses, 350 ms train duration). To measurerelative changes in the force-frequency relationship followingtirasemtiv dosing, the muscle was stimulated at 5 Hz for the courseof the experiment. Twitch force was the force of a single stimuluscontraction-relaxation sequence measured at 10 Hz stimulus.Excessive tissue drying was alleviated by periodically drippingKrebs buffer (117.5 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4,1.18 mM MgSO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 25 mM NaHCO3, 11 mMglucose) onto the exposed muscle. This preparation was stable for3\u20134 hours.Tirasemtiv was administered in solution (50% PEG300/10%EtOH/40% Cavitron cyclodextrin formulation) as a single slowbolus over a 2 minute period via a catheter in the contralateralfemoral artery placed above the aortic bifurcation. Tirasemtiv bolusinjections (2, 2, 2, and 4 mg/kg) were given at approximately20 min intervals to achieve a cumulative dose of 10 mg/kg in order to assess the dose response, with a maximal dosage volumeof 5 ml/kg. At the end of each experiment, a single terminal bloodsample was drawn via cardiac puncture for compound concentrationanalysis. Muscles were excised, the length and weight of themuscle measured, and the force was normalized to the physiologicalcross sectional area of the muscle (N/cm2, described in (8).Metrics measured from these experiments included stimulated andbaseline tension.",

After 10 minutes of equilibration, vertical strips spanning the floating rib to the centraltendon were cut from diaphragms. Braided silk sutures were tied atthe central tendon and floating rib and attached to a forcetransducer between two platinum electrodes. Diaphragm stripswere set to a length that produced maximum twitch tension (Lo).The force-frequency profile of the muscle was obtained bystimulating the muscle at frequencies between 10\u2013150 Hz (GrassStimulator, 0.6 pulse width, 800 ms train duration).

Beginning at approximately nine weeks of age, B6SJLSOD1G93A transgenic mice were fed Harlan Teklad Rodent Diet8604 chow containing tirasemtiv (400 ppm for females or 600 ppmfor males), or control chow. The different doses were structured to achieve comparable plasma levels in the different sex mice. Micewere weighed and assessed for clinical signs once per week using ascoring system composed of three metrics: Gait, balance andability to ambulate, each scored on a five point scale by the investigator during the course of the study. Once muscle weaknesswas evident, animals were weighed and scored more frequentlybased on the severity of weakness. Humane endpoints used todetermine time of euthanasia included weight loss of greater than20%, dual limb (hind limb or forelimb) paralysis or a lowexpectation of survival until the next time point. Investigators judging animal viability were blinded to whether or not animalswere being treated with control chow or tirasemtiv-formulatedchow. The median age of survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method for the vehicle control and tirasemtiv-treated micerespectively.

SOD1-G93A mice on the C57BL/6 background exhibitdelayed onset of clinical symptoms and extended lifespan as compared to the commonly usedB6SJL hybrid strain [40], although the overall duration of disease is unchanged. Study animalswere generated by backcrossing male B6.Cg-Tg (SOD1 G93A)1Gur/J mice (obtained fromThe Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) to C57BL/6J females. Mice were genotyped by PCRof tail-tip DNA and housed under standard conditions with free access to food and water.For drug studies, SOD1-G93A transgenic animals from the same backcross generation wererandomly assigned to treatment groups at 55 days of age. Both males are females were used,and sexes and littermates were balanced across treatment groups. AK7 (20 mg/kg) or vehicle(5% Cremaphor in PBS) was administered daily via i.p. injection beginning at 60 days of age,before time of disease onset, which is 120 days of age. Mice were weighed and assessed twiceweekly for the first signs of disease onset using a standard neurological scoring system for ALSmice. Onset of symptoms was determined by the first appearance of neurological deficit, definedas the inability of the animal to fully splay its hindlimbs when briefly held suspended byits tail. Survival is defined as age at death or euthanasia due to end-stage disease. An animal atend-stage disease is euthanized when it cannot 1) right itself within 15 seconds of being placedon its side, 2) groom its face (detected by the development of infections in one or both eyes), or3) move around to reach food placed on the cage floor.

Wild type mice (8\u201310 week-old male C57B6/J; Charles River Labs) were treated with AK7(30 mg/kg i.p., diluted in 5% cremophor in PBS) or vehicle once at reperfusion (post-ischemic cohort). In a separate cohort, mice were treated twice a day for two days before strokeinduction, and then received a dose immediately before the stroke and an additional dose inthe evening (peri-ischemic cohort). Because outcomes did not vary between post-ischemic andperi-ischemic treatment paradigms, the data were pooled. Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane(3% induction, 2% maintenance in 30% O2, 70% N2O), and rectal temperature maintained between36\u201336.5\u00b0C (FHC, ME, USA). Cerebral blood flow was continuously monitored over theparietal cortex by laser Doppler during the entire procedure. After midline incision, the rightcarotid artery bifurcation was dissected and external carotid ligated. A clip was then placed onthe internal carotid artery, common carotid temporarily ligated. A commercial silicon coatedfilament (7019, Doccol Corp, MA, USA) was then inserted through the external into the internalcarotid artery, and advanced to the middle cerebral artery origin, occlusion of which wasconfirmed by cerebral blood flow reduction to less than 20% of baseline. The filament wasgently pulled out after 1 hour and common carotid ligation released. Successful reperfusionwas confirmed by restoration of cerebral blood flow. Mice were placed in a temperaturecontrolledincubator with easy access to food and water, and body weight was monitored.Neurological outcomes were scored 24 hr after stroke using the following grading system:no neurological deficit (0), forepaw extension deficit during clasping reflex (1), circlingbehavior (2), comatose (3) and death (4). Mice were euthanized 24 hr after stroke onset with alethal dose of isoflurane followed by decapitation. Infarct volume was assessed in a blindedfashion by integrating the infarct area in ten 1-mm-thick coronal sections soaked in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma, St. Louise, MO) for 15 min protected from light. Infarctvolume was calculated by subtracting the volume of ipsilateral non-infarcted tissue from thecontralateral hemisphere.

Untreated mice received SF11-027, adiet with ingredients typical to other mouse diets (Specialty Feeds, Glen Forrest, WA, AUS).Treated wild-type and hSOD1G93A mice received a matched formulation (SF11-028, SpecialtyFeeds) in which 35% of the calories were from triheptanoin. This dose was chosen, as it is alsoused in the clinic to treat patients with metabolic disorders and has shown beneficial metabolicand protective effects in several animal models of various disorders [55,56,60,62\u201364,66]. Thediets were matched in protein, mineral, antioxidant and vitamin content relative to their caloricdensities [66]. Triheptanoin replaced sucrose, some of the complex carbohydrates and longchain fats. For the motor neuron count experiments, triheptanoin was provided by UltragenyxPharmaceutical Inc.

The L4 to L5 regions were identified according to standardanatomical guidelines described in [67] using an Olympus BX61 upright light microscope with10x, 20x and 40x objectives. Briefly, the L4 and L5 sections were identified according to thearea of the gracile fasciculus and dorsal corticospinal tract relative to the spinal cord centralcanal. In L3 sections, the dorsal corticospinal tract is smaller than in L4 and L5. Motor neuronnumbers in L4 and L5 were determined using stereological principles based on the counting of every 10th section with a total of 11 to 16 sections counted [68]. Every tenth consecutive L4 andL5 spinal cord section was counted until the sacral dorsal commissural nucleus appeared concomitantwith a decrease in size of the gracile fasciculus and dorsal corticospinal tract, whichare markers for L6. Motor neurons were identified by a large, darkly stained cell body, a palenucleus with a continuous boundary and one or more darkly stained nucleoli [67].",

G348C mutation was introduced usingsite-directed mutagenesis in the appropriate vector using QuikChangeXL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) as previously described(Kabashi et al., 2010b). cDNA constructs encoding N-FLAG and C-Mycwere incorporated and subcloned into pCS2  plasmid vectors, whichwere subsequently used to generate mRNA.Injections in 1\u20132 cell stage blastulae were performed as previously described (Kabashi et al., 2010b). Briefly, wtTARDBP and mutTARDBP(G348C) mRNAs were transcribed from NotI-linearized pCS2  usingSP6 polymerase with the mMESSAGE Machine Kit (Ambion). ThemRNA was diluted in nuclease-free water (Ambion) with 0.05% FastGreen (Sigma) to a final concentration of 25 ng/ l and backfilled in apulled (Sutter Instrument) thin-walled borosilicate capillary tube andpressure injected into the cell using a PicoSpritzer III (General Valve).Unlike stable expression of zebrafish TARDBP mRNA (measured byqRT-PCR), human wtTARDBP or mutTARDBP mRNA were undetectableat 54 hpf, suggesting that the mRNA had degraded by this time;protein levels of wt and mut TDP-43 were comparable, as previouslyreported (Kabashi et al., 2010b). In that study we determined that expressionof wtTARDBP following injection of 25 ng/ l mRNA was sufficientlyhigh to rescue the loss-of-function phenotype (followingknockdown of the zebrafish gene) while not high enough to cause anonspecific phenotype upon injection of wtTARDBP mRNA alone. No obvious gross anatomical disparity in larval body was observed acrosstreatments at 54 hpf. Nor was there any apparent delay in development asmigration of the lateral line primordium (used for staging development;Kimmel et al., 1995) was unaffected by exogenous mRNA expression.",

The specificity of immunostainingwas confirmed by omission of the primary antibody.Double immunofluorescence was performed to demonstrate the gliallocalization of TNF-  and FasL. Sections were incubated for 18 h in theprimary antibody mixture containing anti-TNF-  or anti-FasL and the astrocyte marker anti-GFAP.

Glutamate\u2013malate (2.5mM each) and succinate (5mM) were used to quantify complex I- and II-dependent respiration,respectively. Rotenone (2  M) and antimycin A (AA; 2  M) were used as complex I and III inhibitors, respectively. For each complex respiration,we also tested the addition of the ATPase inhibitor oligomycin (5  M)and the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). ADP was used to evaluate mitochondrial coupling. The respiratory control ratio (RCR) was calculatedas the ratio of oxygen consumption rates after (state 3) and before (state4) ADP addition. The purity of the mitochondrial fraction was confirmed by measuring cytochrome c oxidase and lactate dehydrogenase activities as markers of mitochondria and cytosol, respectively (Radi etal., 1991).",

Primary antibodieswere applied overnight, and secondary antibodies were applied for1 h. Revelation was performed using the Vectastain ABC kit (VectorLaboratories, Burlingame, CA). For ChAT immunostaining, the method was adapted to a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Pictures weretaken with a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) digital camera DXM 1200.

Only spontaneous activity with a peakto-peak amplitude of at least 50  V was considered to be significant.Fibrillations were graded from 0 to 4: no fibrillations (0), persistent singlestrains of potentials (longer than 2\u20133 s) in at least two areas of the muscle(1), moderate number of potentials in three or more areas (2), manypotentials in all areas (3), or full interference pattern of potentials (4).",

        "text": "Clinical Trial. Study design and patients. We conducted a 15-month parallelgroup randomized study of adults with ALS, diagnosed according to the El Escorial revised diagnostic criteria (47), with a disease duration of  5 years. The study protocol was approved by the Neuromed IRCCS Ethical Committee, and all subjects provided written informed consent. Initial statistical analysis determined that at least 40 subjects were needed to determine, with a 95% confidence interval, a survival increase  6 months. The present study was performed on 44 patients (20 male and 24 female). No familial case was present. Eleven patients presented the bulbar form of the disease, and the remaining presented the classic onset. Sixteen patients (eight male and eight female, four of whom had the bulbar form) were randomly selected to receive riluzole (Rilutek 50 mg, 1 tablet   2/day) plus lithium (Carbolithium; two daily 150-mg doses of lithium carbonate), and the remaining (12 male and 16 female, 7 of whom had the bulbar form) received riluzole only (48). In this way, we carefully matched lithium-treated and control patients for bulbar forms and FVC at the time of their inclusion in the study. In particular, the FVC values were 89 10 and 91 10 for lithium-treated and control patients, respectively. Again, the bulbar forms were distributed similarly between the groups (4/16 25%) in the treated group and (7/22 32%) for controls. One physician was not blind to group assignment; however, clinical evaluation, measurement of FVC, and data analysis were conducted by other physicianswhowere blind to group identities (single-blind study). In this way, the first physician was able to monitor lithium concentration and to adjust the daily dose from 300 mg up to 450 mg daily when lithium plasma levels were  0.4 mEq/liter. In fact, the daily dose was selected to reach a plasma range of 0.4\u20130.8 mEq/liter. Compliance and adverse effects were monitored throughout the study period. Subjects were assessed six times (at baseline and every 3 months for 15 months). The primary endpoint of the present study was the survival rate. The secondary outcomes measured changes in global function, as scored by the ALSFRS-R (49), a widely used and extensively validated functional scale for ALS (normal score, 48); and by the Norris ALS scale. This disability score includes evaluation of the functioning of upper and lower limbs, also taking into account bulbar function. This score uses 34 items rated with a value from 0 to 3, and the normal score is 100. Quality of life (SF-36) (50) was also evaluated. In parallel, we assessed the disease progression with more objective measures, such as quantitative segmental muscle strength (by the MRC scale) and the pulmonary function (FVC). The use of these combined approaches is very useful in small brief clinical trials (see Discussion in SI Text for a comparison of reliability between different scales)",
