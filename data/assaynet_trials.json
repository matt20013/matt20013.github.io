The study includes 20 subjects (age: 20-70) with definite diagnosis of ALS and ALS-FRS-R score of at least 20 and disease-duration of less than 3 years. The treatment protocol includes four intrathecal injections of MSC, at intervals of 3 months between the injections. The primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Several efficacy measures are assessed as secondary endpoints.\n\nApplications from patients are received in our centre. An independent selective committee set by hospital's administration examines anonymously, according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After inclusion and screening visit, patients are followed up for a \"run-in\" period of 6 months before the first visit (visit 1), to evaluate the progression rate of their disease. and for six months following the last transplantation.\n\nOne month after inclusion, patients undergo bone Marrow Aspiration (BMA) procedure and MSC cells are produced from the bone marrow aspirate. On the treatment visit, the patients are transplanted with an intrathecal (IT) injection of MSC (1 million cells per kg of body weight) and thereafter with additional injections every 3-6 months. After the MSC transplantation patients are examined on a bimonthly basis and evaluated for ALSFRSr scoring and forced vital capacity of the lungs (FVC) for a total follow up period of 3 months post last MSC-injection.\n\nTo establish the progression rate of the disease the monthly changes in the functional ALS score: ALSFRSr will be calculated during the 6 months-\"run in period\" and for the whole duration of the study, ending at 3 months following the last injection of MSC stem cells. The progression rate (as evidenced by the monthly changes in ALSFRSr and FVC) during the study (calculated at last visit time point, 3 months after the last MSC-injection) will be compared to the progression rate during the \"run-in\" period.\n\nThe follow up visits include observation for side effects, full neurological evaluation and muscle chart, ALS score and forced vital capacity (FVC) test. The safety is assessed following treatment with MSC, using measurements of the following variables: physical examination, vital signs (HR, BP, RR, body temperature), and clinical laboratory parameters: WBC with differential and platelet count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), blood chemistry for electrolytes, creatinine and liver enzymes.\n\nAll selected patients undergo bone marrow aspiration under light general anaesthesia and an inoculum of crude bone marrow cells (150 ml) is obtained and two thirds of it kept frozen. One third is cultured under GCP conditions at the human cell cultures clean room facility of Hadassah HMO. The MSCs are obtained from the bone marrow of each patient and prepared using our previously described protocol with slight modification.\n\nOne month later the patient is hospitalized and a lumbar puncture performed under standard conditions and local anaesthesia at the L4-5 lumbar level and 3 ml of CSF are removed and the cultured purified MSCs (1x106/kg of body weight) resuspended in 3 ml of normal saline are injected in the CSF, using a 20-gauge needle and 3-way cannula.",

A radiotracer is a substance that chemically marks certain structures in the body. In this case, [11C]CPPC highlights structures expressing colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF1R), a receptor that is expressed on microglial cells. A safety and tolerability study is looking to see if there are any unanticipated, possibly harmful, effects of the use of the radiotracer in humans. However, ultimately, the investigators would like to know if this drug can be used to make better images of the brain for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which could help doctors better understand the disease and help take care of patients with ALS. This study will use a radiotracer to look for a chemical receptor which ALS patients have more of in the brain. After receiving the radiotracer, participants' brains will be scanned with a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging machine.",

The purpose of this study is to find out if lithium carbonate is safe to be used in people with ALS and if it can slow the progression of the disease.\n\nA recent article was published in a highly regarded medical journal that showed a positive effect of lithium carbonate on an ALS type mouse. The researchers then studied a very small number of people with ALS, giving 16 people lithium carbonate with riluzole and giving 28 people only riluzole. The people who took lithium remained stronger for a considerably longer period of time. However, the study was very small and we cannot really tell if lithium works unless a larger study is performed. It is not well understood why lithium carbonate might be helpful but it is believed that it may play a role in protecting the motor nerves from the damage of ALS.\n\nIf you choose to participate, you will need to go to your study clinic for research study visits 7 times in one year and you will have 4 telephone interviews during that time. These visits and phone calls could take up to 17 hours in total.\n\nCaution: Lithium is an FDA approved drug used for some psychiatric disorders. It is not FDA approved for ALS.

        "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if memantine at 20 mg BID when used in conjunction with riluzole, can slow down the disease progression of patients with ALS including potentially improving their neuropsychiatric changes, as well as determine if serum biomarkers can be used both as a diagnostic and a prognostic marker in patients with ALS.\n\nFunding Source: FDA-OPD",
        "detailed_description": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects 30,000 Americans each year. Of these 30,000 Americans, it has been suggested that up to 50% will experience cognitive and behavioral changes in the form of frontotemporal dysfunction and up to 40% will meet criteria for frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Riluzole the only FDA approved agent for ALS extends a patient's lifespan by 2-3 months, and there are no proven therapies for the cognitive changes associated with ALS. More effective therapy for this universally fatal disease is desperately needed.\n\nResults from an open label pilot trial of 20 patients treated with memantine at 10 mg BID suggested that treatment with the combination of memantine and riluzole slowed ALS disease progression. This trial also showed that levels of specific protein biomarkers in the CSF at baseline correlated with the rate of disease progression. A concurrent phase II study performed by Dr Carvalho, found no effect with similar dosing; however, the study was limited in terms of power. Comments on previous failed drug trials in ALS have raised the concern that many ALS trials study a potential therapeutic agent at only a single dose and thus may miss the potential efficacy of non FDA approved doses; therefore, this proposed study will test a higher dose of memantine, 20 mg BID, in a double blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial of 90 patients with ALS to determine if a therapy of memantine, especially in combination with riluzole, can slow disease progression compared to treatment with riluzole alone or no treatment. The primary outcome measure will be the rate of disease progression as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale- Revised (ALSFRS-R). In addition the investigators will examine the cognitive deficits seen in ALS patients measured by the ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Finally the investigators will examine specific validated protein serum biomarkers to determine if there is a correlation between the levels of these biomarkers and the rate of disease progression. In particular the investigators will measure the ratio of phosphorylated heavy neurofilament to Complement 3 to see if this ratio is predictive of disease progression and if the levels change during therapy with memantine.\n\nThis project will offer unique insights into this untreatable disease. If this study confirms earlier results and suggests that memantine, when used in conjunction with riluzole, significantly slows down the progression of the disease, as well as ameliorates cognitive deficits in patients with fronto-temporal dysfunction, it will set the groundwork for conducting a larger phase III trial.",

        "brief_summary": "The objective of this study is to determine whether creatine slows disease progression in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a progressive uniformly lethal neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no known cure. Recent genetic and biochemical studies implicate free radical toxicity, glutamate excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction as possible causes of familial ALS (FALS) and sporadic ALS (SALS). It has been hypothesized that in ALS there may be involvement of oxidative free radical damage and impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism that could in turn lead to excitotoxic cell death. Creatine, an agent that improves mitochondrial function, has been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of ALS and Huntington's disease.\n\nThis study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the safety and efficacy of creatine in patients with ALS enrolled at sites distributed throughout the United States, including Northeast ALS (NEALS) sites. The study will provide preliminary data on the safety and efficacy of creatine in ALS. If creatine slows disease progression in ALS and is well tolerated, a phase 3 study with survival as the primary outcome measure will be initiated.\n\n114 eligible subjects will be randomized to receive treatment for 6 months of (1) active creatine or (2) placebo. After randomization, subjects will be followed prospectively for 6 months. The primary outcome measure for the study is the change in upper extremity motor function after 6 months of experimental therapy as tested with the Tufts Quantitative Neuromuscular Exam. Strength in eight arm muscles will be measured (bilateral shoulder and elbow flexion and extension). Secondary outcome measures include grip strength, motor unit number estimates (MUNE), the ALS functional rating score-revised (ALSFRS-R), and rate of change of a well established biochemical marker of oxidative damage to DNA (8OH2'dG levels in urine), and the safety and tolerability of creatine.",

However, mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in impaired energy production, oxidative stress and apoptosis, may play a key role in ALS progression. Triheptanoin can improve mitochondrial function and energy production and therefore has potential for slowing ALS progression. Indeed, triheptanoin slowed motor neuron loss and delayed the onset of weakness in a mutant SOD1 model of ALS. This pilot trial will determine if Triheptanoin is safe tolerable, alters biomarkers of brain energy metabolism and oxidative stress, and slows functional decline in people with ALS.",
        "detailed_description": "This is an open label, prospective cohort study of 10 people with ALS (PALS) from the Duke ALS Clinic. The first 5 enrolled PALS (Group 1) will receive standard ALS care for the first month, then standard care plus Triheptanoin for the next 5 months. The next 5 enrolled PALS (Group 2) will receive standard ALS care plus Triheptanoin for 6 months (Figure 1). All Group 1 and Group 2 PALS who complete this 6-month study will have an option for Triheptanoin treatment extension for an additional 12 months. In addition to the PALS, there will also be 5 healthy controls enrolled (Group 3), people that do not have ALS or any other neurodegenerative disease). These participants will not receive any treatment; the only outcome measure they will complete is serum and urine biomarker testing at screening/baseline, month 1 and month 6.\n\nThe rationale for delaying triheptanoin treatment in one group is to look for differences in MR spectroscopy related to treatment at the 1 month time point. The target triheptanoin dose for this study is 1g/kg/d. This target dose was selected because it was safe and tolerable and altered brain MR spectroscopy in patients with Huntington's Disease. Participants will taper up to this dose as follows: start at 0.25g/kg/d for 1 week, then take 0.5g/kg/d for 1 week, then take 1g/kg/d and stay on this dose for the duration of the study. Triheptanoin will be administered orally with food or by gastrostomy tube over 3 divided doses (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). If at any point after week 1 a participant does not appear to be tolerating their current dose, it will be reduced by 0.25g/kg/d. If they cannot tolerate the starting dose of 0.25g/kg/d, the treatment will be discontinued. A dietician will make contact with all participants every month, either in person or by telephone, to try and maximize compliance.\n\nThe primary outcome measure is the ALSFRS-R score obtained monthly for all treated participants (in person at screening/baseline, month 1, month 3 and month 6; via telephone at months 2, 4 and 5). We will also obtain this measure by phone at months 6 and 12 of the extension. For all enrolled PALS in Groups 1 and 2, we will compare the slope of ALSFRS-R progression before enrollment to the slop of ALSFRS-R progression during the trial. ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (five minute) ordinal rating scale (ratings 0-4) used to determine patients' assessments of their capability and independence in 13 functional activities. All 13 activities are relevant in ALS. Initial validity was established in ALS patients by documenting that their change in ALSFRS-R scores, which correlated with change in strength over time, was closely associated with quality of life measures, and predicted survival. The test-retest reliability is greater than 0.88 for all 13 itemsactivities. The ALSFRS-R declines linearly with time over a wide range during the course of ALS. The minimum clinically significant change in this scale is said to be 20%. The measure can be reliably conducted over the phone.\n\nSecondary outcome measures include:\n\nMR Spectroscopy NAA/Cr ratio in motor cortex will be measured at screening/baseline and 1 month time points. This measure declines over time in patients with ALS. This measure can respond to treatment; it was shown to improve over 3 weeks in patients with ALS on riluzole compared to a group that was not on this treatment. We will compare the MR spectroscopy changes over 1 month in Group 1 to the MR spectroscopy changes over 1 month in Group 2.\n\nA Serum and Urine Biomarker Panel will be obtained at screening/baseline, 1 month and 6-month time points and analyzed using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Laboratory, pathologic, and epidemiologic evidence clearly supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress is central in the ALS pathogenic process, particularly in genetically susceptive individuals. Oxidative stress biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and urine are elevated, suggesting that abnormal oxidative stress is generated outside of the central nervous system. Magnitude of lipid peroxidation, measured as non-enzymatic oxidation products of arachidonic acid, F2-isoprostanes, appears the most obvious oxidative stress marker. We will measure urine F2-isoprostane metabolites (class III: iPF2\u03b1-III, and 2,3-dinor iPF-2alpha-III, class VI: iPF-2alpha-VI, and 8,12-iso-iPF-2alpha-VI), urine creatinine, and serum and urine glutamate, a-keto-glutarate, NADH, coenzyme A levels in all treated participants and healthy controls at screening/baseline, month 1 and month 6 time points. We will compare the biomarker changes at different times points across between Groups 1, 2 and 3.\n\nFor safety monitoring:, concomitant medications, vital signs, weight, physical exam and safety labs (CBC, CMP, Lipid Profile, GGT, LFT and pregnancy testing for sexually active females with child bearing potential) will be measured at screening/baseline, 1 month, 3 month, and 6-month time points. Adverse events will be monitored continuously throughout the study, as described in Section 5.1.\n\nThe primary statistical analysis is the slope of the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) during treatment compared to pre-treatment. Pre-treatment slope for each participant will be estimated as follows: (48-enrollment ALSFRS-R)/months since symptom onset. This frequently used \"pre-slope\" method is simple and inexpensive, and can predict disease progression as well as more complicated and expensive tools, at least for periods of less than 1 year.",

In this phase 2a study the investigators aim to determine whether a combination of anti-retroviral therapy, Triumeq (dolutegravir 50mg, abacavir 600mg, lamivudine 300mg) is tolerated and safe in patients with ALS. As secondary outcomes, ALSFRS-R, ALSQOL, physical examination, neurophysical parameters and respiratory and muscle function will be evaluated. Blood and urine samples will be stored for possible future analysis for viral activity. Subjects will be screened for the study after signing an approved Informed consent document.",

Outcomes will be measured at 4, 8, 12, 20 and 24 weeks. Participants will be followed at 4-weekly intervals for safety and clinical measures.\n\nSubjects will be screened for the study after signing an approved Informed consent form. As part of the 14 day screening phase, subjects will undertake an extensive medical and neurological assessments.\n\nFollowing the screening phase subjects will enter the 8 week lead-in-phase. During this phase, they will undertake two ALSFRS-R at 4 week intervals. The ALSFRS-R will be undertaken with the subject by telephone.\n\nAt the baseline visit, following the lead-in-period, blood and urine will be taken for safety monitoring and also bio-banked for possible future measurement of Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs). Baseline signs and symptoms will be collected.\n\nAll subjects will have their inclusion and exclusion criteria checked at the Baseline visit (Week 0) and eligible subjects will start the Triumeq.\n\nSubjects will return to the centre on Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24 and at 7 days after the last dose of investigational product (or early termination) to undertake a neurological examination as well as an assessment of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), neurophysical index (NPI), forced vital capacity (FVC) as measured by handheld spirometer, SNIP test and quantitative hand muscle testing by dynamometry. All subjects will undertake an evaluation of hematological and biochemical parameters and collection of blood and urine samples for bio-banking. A voice recording will be undertaken.\n\nAt early termination visit, subjects will undergo an ECG Test. At baseline, weeks 8, 16 and 24 or early termination visit subjects will be asked to complete the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. At screening week 8 and end of treatment/early termination visit, subjects will also be asked to complete an ALSFRS-R.\n\nSAE's, AE's and changes to concomitant medications will be observed and evaluated throughout the study. Each study visit will have a 7 day window after the due date to account for scheduling conflicts/holidays/weekends.\n\nSubjects will be given additional study product to account for the 7- day window.",

The investigators also want to find out if tocilizumab is safe to take without causing too many side effects.\n\nCurrently ALS has no cure and 2 modestly effective treatment to slow the progression of the disease. Although not the initial cause of ALS, the immune system plays a role in the death of motor neurons. The immune cells that participate in this process are stimulated by a substance called interleukin-6 (IL-6) whose effect is blocked by tocilizumab and thus, may slow the death of motor neurons and slow the disease.",
        "detailed_description": "This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 16-week study evaluating the safety and tolerability of tocilizumab in subjects with ALS.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of intravenous administration of 8 mg/kg of tocilizumab every 4 weeks vs. matched intravenous placebo administered every 4 weeks over an 8 week period.\n\nThe secondary objectives of the study are to describe the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of sporadic ALS patients, to assess the ability of tocilizumab to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in PBMCs and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with sporadic ALS and to assess the CSF penetration of tocilizumab. Mean peripheral benzodiazepine receptor 28 (PBR28) uptake will be measured in the motor cortices as regions of interest (ROIs), and will be compared between pre- and post-dose, for Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) subjects.\n\nApproximately 5 Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) Centers in the US will participate in the study. Twenty-four subjects will be randomized in the study.\n\nThis study will be conducted in subjects who meet the El Escorial criteria of possible, laboratory-supported probable, probable, or definite criteria for a diagnosis of ALS. At screening, eligible subjects must be at least 18 years old, must have a slow vital capacity (SVC) \u2265 40% of predicted capacity for age, height and gender (and in the opinion of the investigator is able to comply with and complete the trial), and must provide written informed consent prior to screening. Subjects on a stable dose of riluzole and those not taking riluzole, and women of child-bearing age at screening are eligible for inclusion as long as they meet specific protocol requirements. Detailed criteria are described in the body of the protocol.\n\nSubjects participating in the magnetic resonance imaging - positron emission tomography (MRI-PET) portion of the study (MGH only) must meet the following additional criteria.High or mixed affinity to bind translocator protein (TSPO) (Ala/Ala or Ala/Thr,) Upper Motor Neuron Burden (UMNB) Scale Score \u226525 (out of 45) at the Screening Visit.\n\nand have the ability to safely undergo MRI-PET scans based on the opinion of the site investigator.\n\nSubjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or matching placebo every 4 weeks over an 8 week period.\n\nThis research study protocol allows the subject to receive up to 3 infusions of Tocilizumab. Even if the treatment is shown to be of benefit, additional infusions of Tocilizumab beyond that allowed in the protocol cannot be given to the subject while she/he is participating in this study.\n\nSubjects will remain on randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment until the Week 8 visit. Each randomized subject will also have a Week 12 Follow-up visit and Week 16 End-of-Study visit to assess for adverse events (AEs), changes in concomitant medications, to administer the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and selected study procedures.",

In this trial, participants will be taking either 300 milligrams per day of mexiletine, 900 milligrams per day of mexiletine or placebo (non-active study drug). The safety and efficacy of these doses will be compared to see if one dose is better than the other.",
        "detailed_description": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting primarily motor neurons, for which treatment designed to slow or arrest progression remains lacking. Mexiletine is a use-dependent sodium channel blocker that has been FDA-approved for decades for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and more recently to treat neuropathic pain in diabetic polyneuropathy. Mexiletine has been shown also to be protective of neurons following spinal cord, head injury, and cerebral ischemia, largely by blocking excitotoxicity. Based on previous studies, mexiletine appears to penetrate into the central nervous system at concentrations sufficient to confer significant protection. Recent unpublished studies in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Brown at the University of Massachusetts have also demonstrated that mexiletine ingestion in mice genetically engineered to express high levels of mutant cytosolic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) transgene prolongs survival in these animals. As mexiletine already has FDA-approval as an anti-arrhythmic agent, much is known about the pharmacology and safety of this drug in non-ALS patients. We anticipate that by excluding subjects with a known history of cardiac disease and with the known neuroprotectant properties of this medication, mexiletine is a good choice for further study in an ALS clinical trial.",

        "brief_summary": "ALS is a disorder that weakens motor strength and lung function. Rapid loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord of ALS patients causes the symptoms of increasing weakness and loss of muscle function. Motor neurons are responsible for sending signals to muscles in our bodies to trigger movement. While there are drugs to help relieve symptoms of ALS, there is no cure for ALS.\n\nRasagiline is a drug with possible neuroprotective characteristics. Neuroprotective means that the nervous system may be protected against weakening. It is known that rasagiline has possible neuroprotective characteristics, but the effectiveness of rasagiline for patients with ALS has not been tested. Rasagiline is approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.\n\nRasagiline for treatment of ALS is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is investigational. Investigational drugs are studied to find out if they are safe and effective in the treatment of diseases or conditions.\n\nBy doing this study, researchers hope to learn if rasagiline is safe and slows disease progression in patients with ALS.\n\nFunding Source - FDA OOPD (FDA Orphan Products Division).",

Subjects will be in this study approximately 24 weeks. The study drug, clenbuterol, is taken twice a day. As part of this study subjects will have the following tests and procedures: medical history, vital signs, physical examination, blood tests, heart and lung function tests, muscle function test, ALSFRS-R (ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised), thyroid function and for women who can become pregnant, pregnancy tests.",
        "detailed_description": "This is an open label pilot trial in which 25 people with ALS will take clenbuterol orally at 40-80 micrograms twice daily for 24 weeks. In person visits will occur at weeks 0, 4, 12 and 24. Telephone visits will occur at weeks 1, 6, 16 and 20. During these visits several safety and efficacy outcome measures will be performed for research purposes including safety labs, thyroid functions, pregnancy testing, ALSFRS-R, FVC, and muscle strength testing (myometry). The critical test of treatment efficacy will be the comparison of the ALSFRS-R slope during treatment to the estimated pre-treatment slope. All participants will continue to have standard follow up care for their ALS at Duke (for patients followed here) or their local ALS clinic",

Subjects will be assigned randomly (like by a flip of a coin) to receive either Pimozide 2 mg per day or placebo tablets. There will be a fifty-fifty chance of receiving Pimozide or placebo.\n\nParticipants will be on study medication up to 22 weeks, and on study up to 26 weeks. There are 8 clinic visits and 1 phone visit over the course of the Treatment Phase of the study. The second phase which is Observational, is optional with follow-up for up to 5 years from the end of the Treatment Phase.",
        "detailed_description": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease is a neuromuscular disease that results in rapid decline in normal muscle function and tone leading to difficulties with mobility, eating, drinking, breathing, sleeping, and communicating. The disease is progressive and no cure currently exists. Most people diagnosed with ALS succumb within 3 to 5 years. Rilutek\u00ae (riluzole) has been approved as a treatment to slow progression of ALS, but is minimally effective with mean increase in survival of only a few months. Radicava\u00ae or Radicut\u00ae (edaravone) has recently been approved in Canada, USA, Japan and South Korea.\n\nMuscular dysfunction present in people with ALS is caused by nerve breakdown and a dysfunction in the communication between the muscles and the nerves. The area where these communications occur is called the neuromuscular junction. Some recent studies have focused on using different medications to enhance communication at the neuromuscular junction with the goal of improving muscle function as a result. This approach is unproven but may help to slow the progression of the disease.\n\nPimozide is a medication that has been demonstrated to enhance communication at the neuromuscular junction in fish and mice. This study will look at whether Pimozide may help to slow the progression of ALS.\n\nThere are two parts to this study.\n\nTreatment Phase: In the first part of this study, 100 people from several Canadian centres with ALS who have provided their consent will be randomly assigned into one of 2 groups. The first group will receive a dose of up to 2mg of Pimozide per day and the second group will receive placebo (lactose tablets). Subjects will be assigned randomly (like by a flip of a coin) to receive either Pimozide 2 mg per day or placebo tablets. There will be a fifty-fifty chance of receiving Pimozide or placebo.\n\nEach Pimozide tablet contains 2 mg of Pimozide. The matching placebo tablets for this study will look exactly like the Pimozide tablets. Placebos are used in clinical trials to find out if the results observed in the study are due the drug being tested, or for other reasons.\n\nNeither the subject nor their doctor will know which group a patient belongs to. However, if an emergency should arise, information about a treatment group will be shared with their doctor to ensure appropriate medical care. Participants will take their treatment once a day, every day for about 22 weeks. The total time in the study from the screen visit up until the last phone call communication is about 26 weeks.\n\nObservational Phase: The second part of this study is optional. It is each subject's decision whether to participate only in the first part of this study, or in both parts of the study, or not at all. In the second part of this study, the Canadian Neuromuscular Disease Registry (CNDR) will collect data on overall ALS progression using the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and breathing using Vital Capacity data collected during breathing tests. This information will be collected from a subject medical record following each routine clinical appointment. Data will be collected at each routine clinic visit for up to 5 years from the end of the first part of the study. There will be no extra visits for this part of the study beyond routine ALS clinic visits.\n\nThe information collected during this part of the study will be used to compare the progression of ALS, after the clinical trial is completed, among the two treatment types (Placebo or 2 mg per day). By analyzing this information, the researchers conducting this study hope to determine if Pimozide may help to slow the progression of ALS. To participate in this part of the study consent must be provided to join the CNDR. A subject who hasn't already provided their CNDR consent, and wishes to participate in this part of the study will be given a CNDR consent form to review and sign in addition to this consent form. A subject already participating in the CNDR will just need to sign the main study consent form.",

Its purpose is to evaluate the safety and clinical effects of 3 dose levels of TCH 346 compared to placebo in patients with a clinical diagnosis of laboratory-supported probable, probable or definite ALS. The study will require patients to visit the study center a total of at least 7 times over the course of up to 14 weeks. The study consists of 2 phases: A screening phase (up to 2 weeks) when patients will be evaluated for eligibility to participate in the study, and a double-blind treatment phase (12 weeks) when patients will receive daily doses of either TCH346 or placebo and will be evaluated for clinical effects. In addition, patients eligible to participate in this study will be required to have 3 magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) scans. The MRS is a non-invasive, painless, \"brain scan\". The MRS will require traveling to a designated center in Montreal, Canada, which is very experienced in performing such MRS scans in ALS patients.",

In this clinical trial (TCIM / ALS, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02286011) we studied with electrophysiological techniques (in a small number of patients with ALS) the effects of intramuscular injection of a single dose of BMSC in the tibialis anterioris (TA) muscle. .

He will be contacted by telephone in 2 and in 8 weeks (percentage of decrease of functional embarrassment, percentage of decrease of salivary secretion rate). He can be able to benefit in the open label phase of a botulinum toxin type A injection at the 12-week follow up if he estimates that first injection was not effective or if the efficiency of the first injection began to become blurred.

Penn upper motor Neuron Burden (UMNB), pulmonary function tests, vital signs including height and weight, blood for safety labs including TSPO affinity test, ECG and review and documentation of concomitant medications and therapies.\n\nScreening Phase (up to 6 weeks) The Treatment Phase will consist of a Baseline visit and 3 subsequent clinic visits at Weeks 4, 12, 24, and 36. Telephone follow-ups will occur at Weeks 1, 2, 8, 16, 20, 28, and 32.\n\nOpen-Label Treatment Phase (36 weeks) At the Baseline visit, subjects will return to the clinic and the following assessments will be performed/administered: review of inclusion and exclusion criteria for continued eligibility, vital signs, blood for safety labs and biomarkers, ECG, ALSFRS-R questionnaire, slow vital capacity (SVC), baseline strength as measured by hand held dynamometry (HHD), and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). At this visit, study drug will be dispensed, and adverse events, concomitant medications and therapies will be assessed and documented. At subsequent visits during the Treatment Phase, similar assessments will be performed.\n\nIn addition, a [11C]PBR28-PET scan will be performed once between the Screening and Baseline visit, and once between the Week 20 and Week 28 phone calls. The ALSFRS-R, SVC and U Penn Upper Motor Neuron Burden will be repeated on the same day as the PET scans.\n\nThe follow-up visit will consist of a telephone call to document adverse events and concomitant therapies",

        "brief_summary": "The primary objective is to evaluate the effect, if any, of a single 50 mg dose of Riluzole Oral Soluble Film (ROSF) on swallowing safety in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",
        "detailed_description": "This was a single site, single dose, open-label study with one group of male or female patients between 18-80 years old with a diagnosis of Probable or Definite Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) according to revised El-Escorial Criteria. Patients seen in the ALS Clinic at the University of Florida were screened to determine eligibility for participation in the study according to the specified inclusion/exclusion criteria. Following informed consent and enrollment, subjects were given a complete physical and neurological examination including the validated Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R). Swallowing safety was assessed using the gold standard Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) to allow direct visualization of the swallowing process and any episodes of penetration or aspiration were quantified using the validated Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS). Subjects participated in a standardized protocol that includes 11 bolus stimuli presentations of different liquid and food materials to test swallowing function using a progression of textures and materials. Immediately following this assessment, subjects were given a single dose of ROSF 50 mg, placed on the median lingual sulcus of the dorsum of the tongue (area under the tongue on the midline groove that separates the surface of the tongue into right and left halves). Three minutes after the administration of ROSF, the identical standardized VFSS protocol was re-administered to allow a comparison of swallowing safety (using the PAS scale) pre- versus post-ROSF administration.\n\nThe original plan was to enroll 30 patients for a final sample size of 25 completed patients. The protocol stipulated that, depending upon the study enrollment rate, the Sponsor could elect to perform an interim analysis using available data from the subset of subjects who had completed the study at that time. An interim assessment of the data was performed after 8 subjects had completed the study and a ninth patient had been screened and was awaiting VFSS. With agreement from the FDA, the Sponsor decided to terminate the study after 9 completed patients, based on the analysis of the first 8 completed patients showing no evidence of a harmful effect of one dose of ROSF 50 mg on swallowing function.",

        "brief_summary": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an adult neurodegenerative disease that is caused by a selective degeneration of the motor nerve cells in the cortex and myelon. As a result of motor neurodegeneration, a progredient paralysis of the extremities and of the speaking, swallowing, and breathing musculature develops. ALS leads to death by respiratory insufficiency in a mean course of 3-5 years. So far, Riluzole is the only approved neuroprotective medication which effects a slight lifespan prolongation of 1.5 - 2.5 months. Riluzole inhibits the presynaptic glutamate release and lowers the level of glutamate liberated by activated microglia.\n\nThe researchers propose an investigational therapy of ALS with subcutaneous administration of 100 mg of Anakinra. The neuronal inflammation is a crucial pathogenetic factor of the motor neuron degeneration. Inflammatory processes are detectable in sporadic ALS, in the autosomal-dominant form of ALS and in transgenic mouse model. The rationale of this clinical trial is based on the anti-inflammatory effect of Anakinra. One of the key mediators of inflammatory response is Interleukin-1. Anakinra is a recombinant produced Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. This gives Anakinra anti-inflammatory attributes that presumably reduce motor neuron degeneration and disease progression.",

The rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Fasudil was shown to be neuroprotective, induced axonal regeneration and improved survival and behavioral outcome in models of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this phase IIa, multi-center and double-blind study is to analyze the safety, tolerability and efficacy of fasudil in two different doses compared to placebo in approximately 16 trial sites in Germany, France and Switzerland. Intravenous application of fasudil will be performed in 80 patients and placebo in 40 patients two times daily for 20 treatment days. The hypothesis is that fasudil is safe and well-tolerated and its application will significantly improve the clinical outcome in patients with ALS.",

In this study, MSCs will be taken from the subject's body fat and grown. CSF is the fluid surrounding the spine.\n\nThe use of mesenchymal stem cells is considered investigational, which means it has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine clinical use. However, the FDA has allowed the use of mesenchymal stem cells in this research study.",

Patients will be treated with 10-100 million aaMSCs every 3 months for a total of 4 intrathecal injections over 12 months. Reduced dose treatments will be allowed based on specific adverse events. Multiple biomarkers will be tracked throughout the clinical trial and correlated with response to treatment. This study was initially performed at Mayo Clinic in Rochester and subsequently expanded to the two other Mayo Clinic sites in Arizona and Florida. All biopsies and stem cell injections take place at Mayo Clinic Rochester, regardless of where the subject initially enrolls into the study.",

The overall objective is to determine if Metformin is safe in C9orf72 ALS patients and is a potentially viable therapeutic treatment for C9-ALS that reduces repeat-associated non-canonical start codon - in DNA (non-ATG) (RAN) proteins that are produced by the C9orf72 repeat expansion mutation.",

Metformin, a well-tolerated diabetes drug, blocks a key pathway for expression of toxic proteins produced from the C9orf72 repeat expansion via repeat associated non-canonical start codon - in RNA (non-AUG) (RAN) translation. In mouse model of C9-ALS/FTD, metformin treatment decreases RAN protein levels and improves disease features.

        "detailed_description": "Introduction: Twenty-one ALS patients were enrolled in a placebo controlled pilot study at the Carolinas Neuromuscular/ALS-MDA Center, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and The University of New Mexico at Albuquerque. At all time points sampled over a nine month period, patients taking creatine monohydrate had either a significantly greater improvement in their strength or a more modest decline compared to the patients taking placebo. Overall analysis of variance is significant for both an effect of the drug (p=0.002) and time (p< 0.001).The pilot study also showed that quality of life, as measured by ALSFRS-R, correlated significantly with the observed changes in muscle strength (MVIC).\n\nPhase III Study: The primary objective of this study is to determine whether treatment with creatine monohydrate results in an increase in muscle strength relative to placebo in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), after three months, and at the end of a nine-month treatment period.\n\nThe study is a Phase III, eight-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of creatine monohydrate in patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria. The subjects (n=156) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment of highly purified creatine monohydrate or placebo (Dextrose, USP) for nine months. The subjects will be administered 10 grams of creatine monohydrate per day for the first five days, and then 5 grams per day thereafter. Each subject will be followed for the nine-month treatment period.\n\nThe primary outcome measure for the study is change in upper extremity motor function after three weeks, and at the end of a nine-month treatment period as tested by MVIC. Strength in ten arm muscles will be measured (bilateral shoulder and elbow flexion/extension and grip).\n\nPatient safety will be assured by ongoing review of reports of adverse events, clinical laboratory data, and measurement of vital signs. These tests include: measurement of MVIC and muscle fatigue, measurement of FVC, completion of ALSFRS-R and SF-12 quality of life instruments, review of potential adverse effects, determination of vital signs and weight, serum creatinine and BUN, and urine dipstick for protein.",

        "brief_summary": "The alteration of iron metabolism is reported in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as well as in sporadic and genetic forms (SOD1 and C9orf72) of ALS. The high iron concentration of the brain, due to its high energy demand (high oxygen consumption), makes motor neurons particularly vulnerable to energy deficit and oxidative stress. Post-mortem examinations and MRI scans in patients with ALS have found signs of iron accumulation in the central motor tract; and a high level of serum ferritin, which is a marker of iron levels, is associated with a lower prognosis. In ALS mouse models, the use of iron chelators has demonstrated neuroprotection and increased life expectancy, suggesting that elimination of excess iron from the brain can prevent neuronal loss and, consequently, a slow progression of the disease. Conservative chelation of iron refers to a modality whereby much of the iron that binds to the chelator is redistributed in the body rather than exhausted. Using a chelator, deferiprone, with this feature, in a safety pilot study, a very good safety profile was observed. Deferiprone eliminated excess iron from brain regions, reduced oxidative damage and cell death associated with regional iron deposits with no apparent negative impact on the iron levels needed. Now, the efficacy of this new therapeutic modality of neuroprotection is being evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.",

        "brief_summary": "This will be a multistate, multicenter clinical study to determine the efficacy and safety of medical cannabis for a wide variety of chronic medical conditions.",
        "detailed_description": "Medical cannabis has been legal in parts of the USA since 1996, with the stated intention of reducing pain (both acute and chronic) as well as for treatment of multiple other conditions. The original implementation of medical cannabis in the USA was implemented in California as a compassionate measure to treat the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Additional studies have shown promising outcome for patients with multiple sclerosis, seizures, cancer, and other chronic conditions. However, there have been few comprehensive studies that have actually measured whether cannabis is an effective treatment for pain reduction. There is an absence of multistate, multicenter clinical studies with cannabis as medicine, not only in the USA but globally. With the expansion of medical cannabis into more than 38 states in the US, this type of clinical study is now feasible.\n\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization formally characterized coronavirus, COVID-19, as a global pandemic and health systems globally are continuing their efforts to manage the outbreak. Coronavirus disease COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. With the rapidly growing pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the new and challenging to treat zoonotic SARS-CoV2 coronavirus, there is an urgent need for new therapies and prevention strategies that can help curtail disease spread and reduce mortality. Inhibition of viral entry and thereby spread constitute plausible therapeutic avenues.\n\nThis study will utilize an anonymous novel online questionnaire to determine study participants' qualifying condition(s) for medical cannabis use, cannabis ingestion method, frequency of use, prescription drug use, and demographic information. Secondary factors will include evaluation of pain control, quality of life metrics, any adverse side effects from cannabis use, as well as changes in adjunctive treatments. Patients will be given medical cannabis recommendations and certifications commensurate with the state law in which the encounter occurs. The variations in mechanisms between the states for recommending, registering, certifying, and developing mandated treatment plans or doses will be adhered to; however, variations in state law and cannabis programs should not cause variation in the study design because the end-result is still the same with patients being treated with medical cannabis.",

Two of masitinib's main cellular targets are the mast cell and microglia cell. It is well-established that mast cells play a prominent role in neuroinflammatory processes. Microglia, resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), also constitute an important source of neuroinflammatory mediators and may have fundamental roles in numerous neurodegenerative disorders. The development of masitinib in ALS is therefore based on the pharmacological action of masitinib in microglia cells and mast cells, thereby slowing microglial-related disease progression, reducing neuro-inflammation, and modulating the neuronal microenvironment in both central and peripheral nervous systems. This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group (two ascending dose titrations of masitinib and matching placebo), comparative study of oral masitinib in the treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",

        "detailed_description": "Background:\n\nMany ALS patients suffer from painful muscle cramps, but unfortunately we do not have any medication proven to help muscle cramps in ALS. Reducing the pain caused by cramps - which can be debilitating - could help people living with ALS.\n\nMuscle cramps are sudden, painful, and involuntary contractions of a muscle. They are caused by nerve dysfunction. When we examine nerves and muscles electrically, we see cramps as bursts of high-frequency (up to150 Hz) firing of the motor nerve cells. Cramps in ALS are believed to be the result of an increase of persistent sodium currents in the sick lower motor nerve cells.\n\nA medication called Quinine was for many years the commonly used drug for controlling cramps in ALS, but the FDA has advised against its use for cramps because of its potential risks (e.g., death). Today there is no agreement on how to treat cramps in the ALS. The American Academy of Neurology recently encouraged further studies of the treatment of muscle cramps and suggested lidocaine as one of a few drugs of special interest.\n\nMexiletine:\n\nMexiletine is a medication closely related to lidocaine that can be taken by mouth (instead of being injected). Mexiletine stops the type of sodium currents that are thought to cause muscle cramps. Mexiletine is a relatively older medication that has been extensively studied in humans. It has been shown to reduce the electrical measures of muscle cramps for other disease conditions. For example, in patients with another severe nerve disease - Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3) - mexiletine treatment led to a decrease in the average number of muscle cramps from 24 to 3 cramps per month.. The safety profile of mexiletine is good, with the most frequent side effects being nausea or other abdominal symptoms. These side effects are rare at the doses (300 mg/day) used in this study. In patients with normal heart function, mexiletine has a minimal effect on heart rhythm. In previous clinical trials, no subject developed any serious heart rate problem.\n\nExperimental Plan:\n\nUsing multiple sites within the State of California we will quickly enroll a small number (N=30) of ALS patients with severe muscle cramps. The study is a double-blinded, placebo controlled (i.e., the investigator and the participant does not know if the pills contain mexiletine or placebo), crossover (all subjects receive two weeks of mexiletine and two weeks of placebo) study.\n\nAfter a one week run in, participants will be evaluated on their ability to fill out the cramp diary. Participants who filled out their diary will be randomly assigned to either mexiletine or placebo for their first two weeks. For the first three days of each 2-week period, one 150mg capsule will be taken at bed time. For day 4 to 14 one capsule twice per day will be taken. Each treatment period will be 2 weeks with an intervening 1 week washout period - for a total study length of 6 weeks. Safety will be monitored with liver function studies and EKG's.",

NaPB has shown an improvement in survival in mice with conditions similar to ALS.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN:\n\nAll research participants will take sodium phenylbutyrate for a total of 20 weeks.

        "brief_summary": "A Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled ascending dose titration study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of multiple ascending doses of CK-2017357 to an individual patient maximum tolerated dose (MTD), using a within-patient twice daily (BID) dose-titration regimen in ALS patients on 50 mg riluzole once daily (QD).",
        "detailed_description": "Patients will be randomized to one of two dosing groups, active CK-2017357 or placebo, in a 3:1 ratio. Prior to study drug dosing, patients will be required to decrease their riluzole dose to 50 mg QD for 7 days; after this 7 day period patients will either receive placebo or start the titration on active CK-2017357 while continuing to take riluzole at 50 mg QD.\n\nPotential patients will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 21 days prior to Day -7, when they will begin taking riluzole at the decreased dose of 50 mg QD. Patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to CK-2017357 (Group 1) or placebo (Group 2). On Day 1, patients will begin taking a total daily dose of 250 mg (125 mg BID) of CK-2017357 or matching placebo tablets BID for 7 days. Then they will take a total daily dose of 375 mg (125 mg morning [AM] and 250 mg evening [PM]) of CK-2017357 or matching placebo tablets BID for 7 days, and finally, they will take a total daily dose of 500 mg (250 mg BID) of CK-2017357 or matching placebo tablets BID for 7 days. A final dose of 250 mg of CK-2017357 or placebo will be taken in the morning on Day 22 at the study site.\n\nDose-escalation of CK-2017357 or placebo may be stopped, or the dose reduced to a lower level, based on tolerability. All patients who return to a lower dose will stay on that dose for the remainder of the study.\n\nPatients will remain on the decreased dose of riluzole until the follow-up visit approximately 7 days after Day 22.",

There is currently no known effective treatment for ALS. It is known that nerve cells die in the brains and spinal cords of patients with ALS but the cause of the cell death is unknown. It has been shown that there is overactive nerve activity due to increased levels of a chemical called glutamate and that there is abnormal cellular metabolism along with increased production of substance called \"free radicals.\" Improving cellular metabolism and readjusting the activity of glutamate in the brain may be beneficial to ALS patients.\n\nCreatine is a naturally occurring compound, which improves energy metabolism in cells. Creatine has been given to patients with energy metabolism defects in their muscles, and to athletes. Creatine improves survival in a mouse model of ALS. Three human subjects with ALS have received creatine for up to six months without any side effects. Overall, creatine has been well tolerated and safe.",
        "detailed_description": "Half of the subjects in this study will be selected by chance to receive creatine treatment for 6 months and the other half to receive placebo. Neither the subject nor the investigator will know which drug the subject is receiving, although this information will be available in case of emergency. It is anticipated that all subjects will have the choice to receive creatine after the 6 months study in an open-label study for an additional 12 months. A total of 114 patients will participate at 15 centers. Approximately 8 subjects will be enrolled at the Washington University.\n\nThe effectiveness of creatine will be determined first by assessing any changes in strength in the arms and second by changes in grip strength, functional activities, electromyography changes or changes of the level of SOH 2'dG in the urine.",

        "brief_summary": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/ Motor Neurone Disease (ALS/MND) is a rare and invariably fatal neurological disease. ALS/MND has a terribly high burden on patients, family and carers, and carries great socioeconomic burden. Current best treatment options are expensive and attempt to control disease progression and manage symptoms while offering no cure. Better treatments are wanting.\n\nMonepantel is a well-known veterinary drug, registered as a livestock wormicide in 39 countries. The industry collaborator, PharmAust Ltd, has found that monepantel shows off-target activity, inhibiting a cellular signaling system controlled by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This stops cancer growth and reduces protein accumulation in diseased cells. PharmAust has already tested monepantel in humans and pet dogs in Phase I and II anti-cancer clinical trials, respectively, in Australia. Data from these trials show that monepantel treatment associates with an exceptionally high safety profile, mTOR signaling inhibition and anticancer activity.\n\nAbnormal protein accumulation within motor neurons of the brain associates with the cause of ALS/MND. Inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway slows disease progression in certain preclinical models of ALS/MND and is suggested to provide synergy with the ALS/MND standard-of-care drug, riluzole. An alternative mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, is currently the subject of an ALS/MND clinical trial in humans investigating control of disease progression. Monepantel has a different structure to rapamycin and an apparently better safety profile.\n\nThis Phase I Clinical Trial hypothesis is that monepantel administration to individuals living with ALS/MND will safely reduce disease associated protein accumulation in motor neurons and provide therapeutic benefit. To test this hypothesis, the safety and tolerability of oral monepantel administration and markers of efficacy will be tested in individuals living with ALS/MND in a dose escalating Phase I/II Clinical Trial. To mitigate risk, only patients with sporadic and certain known familial types of ALS will be eligible. To further mitigate risk, the monepantel starting dose will be reduced a calculated five-fold compared to that already used in human cancer patients and already demonstrated to be safe and effective as an mTOR inhibitor. Dependent upon incremental outcomes, three higher doses may then be tested, each for minimally 28 days with a duration at the optimal dose of at least six months.",

        "brief_summary": "The aim of this study is to survey the effect of Tamoxifen in motor neuron disease (MND) patients, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with regular riluzole usage. TDP-43 is related to ALS. Increased the ubiquitinated or phosphorylated TDP-43 can cause animal model of ALS, and TDP43 can be degraded either by proteasome or autophagy pathway system. Autophagy pathway can be activated by mTOR inhibition, resulting in ameliorating TDP-43 accumulation and rescue in motor function in animal model. Tamoxifen had shown ability of enhance both proteasome and autophagy pathway, therefore the investigators assume that Tamoxifen probably can ameliorate TDP-43 accumulation and inclusion body formation in ALS.",

        "brief_summary": "Background:\n\n- Some people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) have a high level of the virus HERV-K in their blood. Researchers do not think this virus causes ALS. But they don t know why some people with ALS have a high level of it. They want to know if HERV-K can be suppressed by drugs that are used to treat HIV infection.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To learn how drugs usually taken for HIV infection affect people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Adults at least 18 years old with ALS and high levels of HERV-K but no HIV.\n\nDesign:\n\nInterested participants can contact the study team and, if eligible, the study team will arrange for a screening blood draw to determine the HERV-K level.\nParticipants with a high HERV-K level will be screened with medical history, physical exam, questionnaires, nerve conduction test, lumbar puncture, and blood and breathing tests.\nAfter screening, participants will start taking the 4 study drugs.\nParticipants will have up to 12 study visits over a period of 72 weeks. After starting study drugs, they will have study visits at Weeks 1 and 4 and then every 4 weeks until Week 28. They will be asked how they are feeling and have an exam and blood drawn. At 3 visits, they will have tests of nerve conduction, breathing, and their ALS symptoms.\nAt Week 24, they will stop taking the study drugs and have a repeat lumbar puncture.\nAfter the Week 48 visit, their participation is finished.",
        "detailed_description": "Objective:\n\nIn this Phase I, proof-of-concept study, we aim to determine whether an antiretroviral regimen approved to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection would also suppress levels of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K (HERV-K) found to be activated in a subset of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We propose to measure the of blood levels of HERV-K by quantitative PCR before, during, and after treatment with an antiretroviral regimen. We will evaluate the safety of the antiretroviral regimen for participants with ALS and also explore clinical and neurophysiological outcomes of ALS symptoms, quality of life, and pulmonary function.\n\nStudy Population:\n\nWe will study a subset of ALS patients who have a ratio of HERV-K:RPP30 greater than or equal to 13. About 30% of ALS patients may have detectable levels of HERV-K; about 20% of patients with ALS have a level >1000 copies/ml. To show whether the HERV-K could be suppressed, we will recruit from the approximately 20% of patients with the high levels so that the antiretroviral effect can be determined.\n\nDesign:\n\nThis is an open-label study of a combination antiretroviral therapy for 24 weeks in 25 HIV-negative, HTLV-negative ALS patients with high ratio of HERV-K:RPP30. The study duration for each participant will be up to 72 weeks. Participants will be followed regularly for safety, clinical, and neurophysiological outcomes.\n\nOutcome Measures:\n\nThe primary outcome measure will be the percent decline HERV-K concentration measured by quantitataive PCR. Percent decline for a patient is measured by: 100 x (screening visit - week 24 visit measurement) / screening visit. The safety of antiretrovirals in volunteers with ALS as measured by the frequency and type of AEs, the ability to remain on assigned treatment (tolerability), physical examinations, laboratory test results, vital signs, and weight/body mass index (BMI). Efficacy will be explored by measuring the change in mean scores of: the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), the ALS Specific Quality of Life Inventory-Revised (ALSSQOL-R), the ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS), vital capacity and maximal inspiratory pressure as measured by handheld spirometer, electrical impedance myography (EIM), the change in neurofilament levels in blood and/or CSF, and the change in uring p75ECD levels.",

        "brief_summary": "This is a multicenter, 15-month study evaluating the effect of immunosuppression treatment on the rate of change on the ALS Functional Rating Scale (Revised) (ALSFRS-R) score in up to 33 subjects with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).",
        "detailed_description": "In an ongoing safety trial of neural stem cell injections into the spinal cord of patients with ALS at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, one patient has demonstrated clear improvement by objective clinical and electrophysiological measures, a finding that is unheard of in patients with ALS.\n\nThis patient had an improvement in ALSFRS-R by 1.4 points per month. In 826 historical controls from the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) and the Western ALS Consortium (WALS) database where ALSFRS-R was documented at 2 or more visits, there have been no patients that have shown improvement in ALSFRS as seen in this case. Additionally, 5 patients in the stem cell trial who were not on mechanical ventilators at the time of surgery seem to have very slow disease progression as compared to the expectation from current understanding of typical disease course. This observation raises consideration for a disease-modifying effect of the novel immunosuppression regimen used in this trial. Also, given that ALS is clinically an extraordinarily heterogeneous disease, the diagnosis of ALS may represent a group of phenotypically similar but pathogenically variable disorders. It is possible that there exists a subset of patients with an immune-responsive ALS subtype that has not been previously recognized.\n\nRecent studies have furthered the understanding of the immune mechanisms that contribute to ALS progression. Microglia and lymphocytes have both neurotoxic and neuroprotective functions depending on activation states and physiologic conditions within the nervous system. Therefore, targeted immunotherapies that proportionally suppress neurotoxic immune elements, while sparing or promoting protective elements, seemingly have more potential to modify disease course in ALS than previously tested regimens. It is postulated that the immunosuppression treatment given to the stem cell patients may have exhibited neuroprotective effects by favorably promoting the ratio of regulatory T cells and other protective immune mediators in relation to neurotoxic immune modulators. It is hoped that this trial will optimize the chance of replicating these findings and advance knowledge about the complex changes that occur within the immune system in patients with ALS before and after treatment with an immunosuppression regimen.\n\nThe primary outcome measure will be rate of change of ALSFRS-R. A clinical response will be defined as a rate of change of ALSFRS-R of +6 points over a 6 month period (mean of change of +1 point per month).\n\nSecondary outcome measures will include slow vital capacity (SVC), grip strength, and hand held dynamometry (HHD). The change in rate of progression in clinical measures will be monitored to look for a potential disease-modifying effect of the immunosuppression regimen. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid immune system markers will be also be studied.\n\nIf a clinical response is seen among study participants following treatment, further analyses will be conducted to explore any differential effects of immunosuppression in participants with early-stage disease and later-stage disease. To ensure adequate numbers of participants for conditional analyses stratifying by symptom onset date, participants will be enrolled based on symptom onset within 24 months of the screening visit or more than 24 months before screening. All participants will have the same treatment and will be treated as a single group for the analyses of the main study outcomes.",

        "detailed_description": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. A substantial body of evidence implicates the neuroimmune system in ALS pathophysiology. Of relevance to this study, microglia activation in the brain has been found to correlate positively with faster rate of disease progression. In addition, studies of blood cells in people with ALS have shown an increased activation of two of the major inflammatory cell types in the body, monocytes and T cells. Among T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been recently proposed to play a role in ALS progression.\n\nRNS60 is an electrokinetically altered aqueous fluid. Chemically, RNS60 is composed of saline and oxygen. The electrokinetic processing of RNS60 in Revalesio's patented Revalesio Pump (RP) produces charge-stabilized nanostructures (CSNs) that exhibit electrical fields. RNS60 is available for intravenous administration and inhalation. RNS60 has been extensively tested in preclinical toxicological studies and has shown very little to no side effects. In addition, RNS60 was well tolerated in three phase I human safety studies, one after intravenous administration and two after inhalation.\n\nPreclinical in vitro and in vivo studies in multiple disease models have demonstrated that RNS60 has broad anti-inflammatory effects. These effects include reduction of microglia activation, increase of the Tregs subpopulation of lymphocytes, and neuroprotection in several disease models.",

Patients with ALS, a history of a relative affected with ALS (i.e. familial ALS) and the presence of a demonstrable mutation in the SOD1 gene that is known to be associated with rapidly progressive disease, will be eligible for inclusion in this study. Potentially eligible subjects will undergo screening via telephone and, if necessary, review of outside medical records. The intervention will continue for up to 12 months. In the event that a participant reaches a study endpoint (e.g. tracheostomy or permanently assisted ventilation) study drug will be terminated. Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will travel a study site for final eligibility determination, baseline evaluation and will then be randomized 1:1 to receive either placebo or arimoclomol at a dose of 200 mg t.i.d. Participants will then be evaluated again in person at a study site at Month-2. Telephonic evaluations at Month-1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 will be performed in participants' homes. Safety and tolerability evaluations will be performed at each of these visits. Collection of blood samples for safety laboratory analyses and measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and weight will be performed at Months-1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 in the participant's home by a representative of a medical monitoring company. A study coordinator may perform an in-person visit at Month-12, or this visit may occur telephonically. A final evaluation will be performed via telephone at Month-13 (30 days after the last dose of study medication).",

        "brief_summary": "Neuroinflammation has recently emerged as a significant contributor to motor neuron damage. ALS tissue is characterized by inflammatory changes that are observed in both sporadic and familial ALS and in the ALS superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) transgenic mouse model. They include an accumulation of large numbers of activated microglia and astrocytes.\n\nProinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), are robustly upregulated in ALS. The receptor for tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-R1) is elevated at late presymptomatic as well as symptomatic phases of disease. TNF acts as a principal driver for neuroinflammation in ALS, while several co-stimulating cytokines and chemokines act to potentiate the TNF effects [4-6].\n\nWe propose an investigational therapy of ALS with oral administration of thalidomide. The rationale for this study is based on the anti-inflammatory properties of thalidomide through the modulation of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF. The primary aim of the trial is to determine whether treatment with thalidomide is safe and well tolerated in conjunction with riluzole and whether patients with ALS can tolerate daily doses of up to 400 mg. The trial is designed as feasibility study in planning for a larger phase IIb/III trial of efficacy.",
        "detailed_description": "Study drug will be provided as 50 mg tablets. Patients will be instructed to take 2 tablets orally once a day during the evening at least 60 minutes after a meal. Thalidomide will be administered starting at 100 mg (Group 1) for 6 weeks. Thereafter, the dose will be increased every week by 50mg until reaching the dose of 400 mg/day. This treatment is continued for 12 weeks. Thalidomide is administered in conjunction with the standard treatment of riluzole (100mg/day).",

        "detailed_description": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder that results in progressive wasting and paralysis of voluntary muscles. It is known that nerve cells called motor neurons die in the brains and spinal cords of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the cause of this cell death is unknown.\n\nIn this double blind, randomized, selection design trial, researchers will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of creatine and tamoxifen in volunteers with ALS. There are a large number of potential drugs that may improve the survival or slow down the disease progression in people with ALS. The current strategy is to test one drug at a time against placebo. \"Selection Design\" is a different type of study design. A Selection Design study uses multiple drugs to screen against each other and picks the winner to take to a larger study. This design can speed the search for effective drugs to treat ALS. In this Selection Design study, each volunteer will take one active study drug (creatine 30gm, tamoxifen 40mg, or tamoxifen 80mg) and one placebo.\n\nApproximately 60 eligible volunteers with ALS will be recruited from multiple centers in the US that belong to the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS). Volunteers will be randomly assigned equally to the three treatment arms: creatine 30gm/day, tamoxifen 40mg/day and tamoxifen 80mg/day. Volunteers will take study treatment for 38 weeks. After screening and randomization, volunteers will be followed at weeks 4, 10, 18, 28 and week 38. A final telephone interview will occur at week 42 (off study drug).",

        "detailed_description": "Physicians at Phoenix Neurological Associates (PNA) are looking for individuals diagnosed with ALS to participate in an open label phase II safety trial with zinc in conjunction with copper, used in combination with Riluzole for treating ALS. This investigator initiated trial conducted by Drs. Todd Levine and David Saperstein will help determine if zinc given at high doses is safe and tolerated and could possibly slow the progression of ALS.\n\nOver fifty years ago an epidemic of ALS was discovered on the Island of Guam where a disease complex of ALS was found to be one hundred times more prevalent than in the rest of the world. Research on ALS in Guam linked ALS, along with Parkinson's Disease and Dementia, with a neurotoxin, \u03b2-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA). BMAA is a non-essential amino acid and is produced by a cyanobacterium found in large concentrations in the food consumed by the people on Guam. Subsequently several groups have identified high concentrations of BMAA in brain tissues of patients from North America and Europe with several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS, Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Diseases.\n\nA small proportion of ALS, (about 2%), is associated with a mutation in the superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene. Mice who express this mutant gene exhibit a progressive, ALS-like neurodegenerative disease.Since it is known that SOD1 binds zinc, and many of the mutant forms of this enzyme associated with ALS show altered zinc binding, zinc may play a key role in all pathological processes associated with ALS. Previous studies have shown that in ALS mutant G93A SOD transgenic mice, actual zinc supplementation delayed death. Zinc has also been thought to serve as an endogenous antioxidant in the central nervous system and help protect the BBB against oxidative stress and prevent BMAA from crossing into the brain.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that BMAA binds exceptionally strongly to transition metal ions such as zinc, copper, and nitrogen. If BMAA crossed over the permeable BBB, and enters a compartment in which glutamate was bound to zinc, then the glutamate/zinc complex would dissociate in favor of zinc having a stronger affinity to BMAA. This could lead to higher levels of unbound glutamate which is believed to be highly neurotoxic in ALS patients. We hypothesize by exposing patients to high levels of zinc, both BMAA and glutamate would be kept in a bound complex with zinc, i.e. eliminating competitive binding for zinc, which lead to less excitotoxic free glutamate and glutamate toxicity would be reduced.",

Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated in the pathophysiology of ALS. Oxidative stress refers to the effects of cell-damaging reactive oxygen species, also known as free radicals. Oxidative stress is thought to contribute to nerve cell loss in ALS. Mitochondria are organelles within each cell that are sometimes called \"powerhouses of the cell\" because cellular energy metabolism is located within the mitochondria.\n\nCoenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a mitochondrial cofactor known for its antioxidant properties, has prolonged survival in the mouse model of ALS and has slowed functional decline in another neurodegenerative disorder, Parkinson's disease. The goals of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-dose comparison phase II study are to obtain preliminary efficacy data and to select the preferred dose for a larger phase III study.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to CoQ10 (at two different dose levels) or placebo in the first stage, then the 2,700 mg dose was selected in the second stage. Duration of the trial was 9 months with a total of 7 visits.",

        "detailed_description": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) belongs to a wider group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases and mainly involves the nerve cells (neurons) in the body. Voluntary muscles produce movements like chewing, walking and talking. ALS is caused by gradual deterioration (degeneration) and death of these motor neurons. The disease is progressive, meaning the symptoms get worse over time and most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within 3 to 5 years from when the symptoms first appear. Currently there is no cure for ALS and no effective treatment to halt or reverse the progression of the disease (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Fact Sheet).\n\nThe aim of this study is to explore the safety and acceptability of a type of low molecular weight dextran sulfate called ILB.\n\nThe investigators will invite 15 patients to take part from a single centre in the UK. Participants will be closely monitored for any side-effects; for changes in ALS symptoms and on quality of life during and after the study.\n\nThe trial period for patient participation is maximum 56 weeks (12 months), ILB injections will be administered once weekly for up to a maximum of 48 weeks.",

In this study, ALS patients will be screened for depression using self-reported multiple choice questionnaire. Patients who fulfill the criteria for depression based on this screening tool will be evaluated by psychiatrist before inclusion in the study. The investigators will also measure quality of life and functional status by simple questionnaires. The patients will be allocated into two treatment groups to receive either TCA or SSRI for 12 weeks. Patients will be evaluated every 4 weeks and phone calls will be made in between the visits if needed to assess about efficacy and any side effects. If any patient reports having suicidal thoughts on any of these phone calls or clinic visits, he/she will be immediately sent to the ER for appropriate management. The investigators will repeat the questionnaires in the clinic visits, and use them in the data analysis to look for any improvement and to compare the two medication classes used in this study. This data may be used later on to do larger studies and help to make standard recommendations in treating depression in ALS patients.",

This is investigator initiated study.This trial will be done at St Louis University ALS clinic. ALS patients will be screened for depression using Beck depression inventory (BDI-II) scale. A mental healthcare provider will evaluate the patients scoring 19 or above, before inclusion in the study. Quality of Life (QOL) assessment by questionnaire (McGill) and ALS functional rating scale (ALS-FRS) measurement will be done at the baseline. Then these patients will be allocated into two treatment groups to receive either TCA or SSRI medication for 12 weeks based on the clinical judgment (non-randomized). Patients will require clinical encounters every 4 weeks and telephone encounters in between the visits to assess the effectiveness of medication and tolerability of the side effects if any. If any patient endorses active suicidal ideation on any of these assessments, he/she will be immediately sent to the ER for appropriate management. At 4, 8 and 12-week clinic visits, repeat BDI, QOL and ALS-FRS measurement will be done on each patient from both groups and used in the data analysis.",

        "brief_summary": "The objective of this study will be to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effect on SOD1 levels by pyrimethamine in patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",
        "detailed_description": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease causing relentlessly progressive weakness of the arms, legs and respiratory muscles that is uniformly fatal. There are approximately 30,000 patients living with ALS in the United States. There is no treatment. The cause is uncertain in most patients. However, 3% of patients (< 1000 in number) have a familial form of ALS (FALS), phenotypically identical to the sporadic illness, that is caused by a mutation in the gene coding for the free radical scavenging enzyme copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Inserting the SOD1 mutant gene into mice causes them to develop a disease closely resembling ALS.\n\nInhibiting expression of the SOD1 gene prevents animals from developing the disease. Increasing or decreasing the number of mutated genes proportionately speeds or slows the progression of the disease. Therefore, reducing SOD1 levels in patients with SOD1 associated FALS may be a promising therapeutic approach. Through an extensive in vitro screening program for medications having the ability to reduce SOD1 levels, several molecules that reduce SOD1 protein levels are known. One of the most potent molecules is pyrimethamine, an FDA approved medication used for the treatment of malaria and toxoplasmosis. Pyrimethamine dramatically reduces SOD1 levels in mice and our preliminary studies show similar findings in humans. Our study's primary objective is to determine if familial ALS patients taking pyrimethamine will show a decline in SOD1 levels in the CSF by 15% or more. We will also determine if SOD1 and pyrimethamine are present in the blood and if the SOD-1 levels decline over the course of the study. We will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of pyrimethamine in patients with FALS. Secondary objectives will be to determine dose optimization for maximal SOD1 level reduction and tolerability of medication. We will also assess the feasibility of proceeding to phase II/III studies using pyrimethamine. Change in ALS-FRS, Appel ALS score and quality of life will also be measured. A clinical effect realized in patients with FALS associated with an SOD1 mutation may serve as an important foundation toward finding a treatment for sporadic ALS.",

        "brief_summary": "This is a 12-month, widely inclusive, largely virtual, single-center, open-label pilot trial utilizing a historical control group. Participants will receive a Lunasin regimen and will be asked to register for an account of PatientsLikeMe website, where after the initial in-clinic visit, they will be asked to enter specific data.",
        "detailed_description": "The primary hypothesis is that a supplement regimen containing Lunasin (referred to as the Lunasin regimen) can decrease the rate of ALSFRS-S progression by 50% relative to matched historic controls.\n\nALS is a devastating motor neuron disease that causes rapidly progressive muscle weakness, disability and premature death. In spite of a large number of attempted ALS trials, there are no significant disease-modifying therapies for this condition.\n\nIt was recently reported that a patient with a validated diagnosis of ALS, had experienced dramatic objective improvement in speech, swallowing and limb strength while taking a supplement regimen containing Lunasin. Several other patients with ALS have also reported improvement on this Lunasin regiment, though records were not obtainable to validate these.\n\nThe Lunasin regimen will consist of:\n\nLunaRich X Capsules\nReliv NOW - a mixture of 'vitamins, minerals and super-powered antioxidants'\nPro-Vantage - a mixture of 'soy protein, medium chain triglycerides, creatine, CoQ10 and supercharged amino acids'\n\nDosages will be titrated up to target over the first 6 days. The subject will take the highest tolerated dosing for the remainder of the 12-month study.\n\nThere are 3 in-clinic visits which occur at screening/baseline, Month 1 and Month 12. For Months 2-11, participants will make \"virtual visits\" by measuring their own ALSFRS-R score and weight and will record it in the PatientsLikeMe website. They will also self-report any perceived efficacy, compliance, adverse events and changes in concomitant medications.",

        "detailed_description": "It is known that nerve cells called motor neurons die in the brains and spinal cords of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the cause of this cell death is unknown. Researchers think that increased levels of a chemical called \"glutamate\" may be related to the cell death. For this reason researchers want to study drugs that decrease glutamate levels near nerves. Ceftriaxone-a semi-synthetic, third generation cephalosporin antibiotic-may increase the level of a protein that decreases glutamate levels near nerves. Studies of ceftriaxone in the laboratory suggest that it may protect motor neurons from injury.\n\nCeftriaxone is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating bacterial infections but not for treating ALS. Also, ceftriaxone has not been given to people over a long period of time, such as months or years. The goals of this study are to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ceftriaxone as a treatment for ALS, and to determine the safety and effectiveness of long-term use of the drug in people with ALS.\n\nA total of 600 eligible people with ALS will be enrolled in this multi-center research study. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with ceftriaxone (2/3 of participants) or placebo (1/3 of participants) for at least 12 months.\n\nThe study consists of three stages. The first stage, which has completed enrollment, will look at whether ceftriaxone enters the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the spinal cord, also called CSF) in amounts that are high enough to be of possible benefit. The second stage, which has also completed enrollment, will look at the safety and side effects of the study drug when taken daily for at least 20 weeks. The study is currently enrolling subjects for the third stage, which began in Spring 2009, and will determine whether the study drug prolongs survival and slows decline in function due to ALS.",

Patients develop progressive wasting and weakness of both upper and lower limbs, bulbar and respiratory muscles. Usually death from respiratory failure typically is within 3-5 years of diagnosis. Although there are various treatments for ALS, riluzole is the only approved treatment to delay the disease progression. Cistanche Total Glycosides is an approved drug that has protective effects. It acts anti-apoptosis by activating several protective pathways, stimulates neuronal differentiation of adult neural stem cells in the brain, and improves long-term recovery. CTG is a highly attractive candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions such as ALS.\n\nPatients 18 to 65 years of age who have had mild to moderately severe ALS for 0.5 to 2 years of duration may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and possible review of medical records, physical examination, blood test, urine and stool analyses, electrocardiogram, electrophysiological examination, neurological imaging and, for women, a pregnancy test.\n\nParticipants will have drug therapy according to randomized number. One group receives CTG while other group receives placebo. For the procedure, patients are given a medication to lessen anxiety and any discomfort. Patients receive drugs for 9 months. The CTG dosage is 1.8g/day. Physical examination and interview, Appel ALS scale and ALS-Functional Rating Scale will be done in 28 days and 3, 6, 9months. Electrophysiological examination will be tested per 3 months. Blood samples will be collected on treat28 days and 3, 6, 9months.",

Complex nature and unknown pathogenesis of this disease are 2 major reasons for failure of therapeutic interventions. Edaravone is a free radical scavenger that slows down functional decline and prevents from disease progression in ALS patients. FDA newly approved this drug in these patients (2017/5/5). In this study, investigators aimed to assess the treatment effect of this newly approved drug in patients with ALS in a representative Iranian population.",

The study objective is to investigate the tolerability, safety and the way the body handles GSK1223249 after a range of single doses or repeat dose escalation in patients with ALS.",
        "detailed_description": "This is the first-time-in-human (FTIH) phase I/IIa study of GSK1223249, a humanised monoclonal antibody against Nogo-A, a neurite outgrowth inhibitor hypothesised to be involved in the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and some other neurodegenerative disorders. This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, sequential dose escalation, 2-part fusion protocol. Approximately 76 patients with ALS will be enrolled. In Part 1, single escalating intravenous (i.v.) doses of GSK1223249 are planned to be evaluated in 5 sequential patient cohorts (2 placebo and 6 active in each cohort) to determine single dose safety and pharmacokinetics (PK). Part 2 will also be of a sequential dose escalating design, but patients in each of the planned 3 cohorts (3 placebo, 9 active in each cohort) will receive 2 repeat i.v. doses approximately 4 weeks apart where, safety and PK will also be evaluated. In two cohorts in Part 1 and all cohorts in Part 2, blood samples and skeletal muscle biopsies will be taken from patients before and at the end of treatment to demonstrate whether or not GSK1223249 binds to its target and produces any measurable pharmacodynamic effect. Patients in both parts will receive their first dose in a hospital-based unit where they will be monitored for at least 24 hours post-dose before being discharged to be followed on an out-patient basis. In each cohort in part 1, the first four subjects will be dosed in a staggered manner such that only one will receive the dose in any 24 hours. Dosing of the first four subjects in the first cohort of part 2 will also be staggered in a similar manner.",

This investigator initiated trial conducted by Dr. Todd Levine and Dr. David Saperstein will help determine whether Tretinoin and Pioglitazone HCL, in combination, can slow the progression of ALS.\n\nAt present, there is little to no effective therapy for ALS, nor is there a known cause. Therefore there is a tremendous unmet need for more effective therapy for this disease and that is why the physicians at PNA have been very interested in the role of developing a more active anti-excitotoxic cocktail for patients with ALS. Since recent data have suggested that inflammatory mechanisms may interact with and promote neurodegeneration (where cells in the spinal cord and brain are lost), there have been a number of anti-inflammatory treatment strategies that have been evaluated in animal models. Some studies have shown that mice that were given Pioglitazone HCL demonstrated improved muscle strength and body weight, exhibited a delayed disease onset as well as had a longer survival rate compared to non treated mice.\n\nIn addition to these studies, retinoic acids have been studied extensively in various models of the injured nervous system. These studies have shown that retinoic acids, such as Tretinoin may be neuroprotective and support axonal growth, which could in turn slow disease progression.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine if such a drug \"cocktail\" could offer the best chance of attaining a significant reduction in disease progression by utilizing currently available FDA-approved agents",

        "detailed_description": "ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder without cure or known treatment that significantly improves function. Loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord of ALS patients causes the progressive symptoms. Laboratory studies have linked inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and caspase enzyme activation to motor nerve cell death in ALS. Minocycline-a medication currently approved by the FDA for treatment of bacterial infections-is a tetracycline antibiotic with high central nervous system penetration when taken orally. The drug inhibits the activity of iNOS and caspase enzymes.\n\nMinocycline has been tested and shown to protect nerve cells in many scientific experiments. It reduces cell death and prolongs survival in animal models of ALS, stroke, trauma, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. It has been shown to be beneficial in many different animal experiments of ALS, conducted in Europe, Canada and the United States.\n\nMinocycline has been tested in 2 preliminary human trials and has been shown to be safe in patients with ALS. It has been well tolerated in conjunction with riluzole (Rilutek), the only currently FDA-approved medication for ALS.\n\nThis trial is the final important step in determining whether minocycline improves the course of ALS. The principle objective of this clinical trial is to determine whether minocycline slows disease progression and helps maintain function in patients with ALS. This multi-center placebo-controlled study will select patients early in the course of ALS, when a neuroprotective therapy may be most beneficial. The study will measure change in function (as detected by ALSFRS-R scores), strength, pulmonary function, survival, and quality of life. Participants will undergo monthly outpatient evaluations and analysis of laboratory and adverse events. This is a 13-month study.",

        "brief_summary": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare lethal neurodegenerative disease involving inflammation. Riluzole, the only drug for ALS, improves median survival by 3 months. This prompts new treatments of ALS. RNS60 is an experimental drug with favorable effects in preclinical studies of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Based on significant efficacy demonstrated in preclinical studies and its excellent clinical safety profile, RNS60 is a promising candidate for a drug to treat ALS. Developing a pharmacodynamic marker will be a first and important step for dose finding and exploration of the mechanism of action in human, and pave the way to trials measuring drug efficacy.\n\nThe Investigator propose a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, Phase II trial. The study centers will be located in Italy and at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston. A total of 142 ALS patients will be randomly assigned to RNS60 or placebo (administered by intravenous infusion once/week and inhaled via nebulization every morning for 24 weeks). All participants will also take riluzole (50-mg tablet twice/day). Blood samples for biomarker analysis (protein, RNA) will be collected in the screening period, on day 1, week 4,12 and 24. Both safety and potential therapeutic effects of RNS60 will be also assessed.",
        "detailed_description": "ALS is a rare neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem and motor cortex. The only drug showing to improve survival in patients with ALS is riluzole. However, the benefits of riluzole only consist in a three-month delay of death while disability and other outcome measures are virtually unaffected. This highlights the need to test novel approaches with documented activity on markers of disease mechanisms and, at the same time, able to slow the progression of the disease.\n\nThe major determinants of motor neuron death in ALS remain to be established. Emerging evidence points to an involvement of the adaptive immune response in disease progression. RNS60 is a novel agent with immunomodulatory properties. Adding to previous reports of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities of RNS601,2,3,4, our group showed a protective effect of RNS60 on motor neurons in both in vitro and in vivo models of familial ALS carrying the SOD1G93A mutation (unpublished data). Therefore, RNS60 presents itself as a promising candidate for the treatment of ALS patients. Its exceptional safety profile, demonstrated both in preclinical toxicology studies and FDA-approved clinical phase I studies upon inhaled and IV administration, supports testing of RNS60 in clinical phase II studies in ALS.\n\nThe investigators have identified six candidate pharmacodynamic markers of RNS60 that have previously been associated with ALS: 1. T-reg (measured via FOXP3 and CD25 mRNA); 2. Cyp-A; 3. 3-NT; 4. Actin-NT; 5. MCP-1; 6. IL-17.\n\nThe investigators have measured and reported the effects on T-reg and IL172 in experimental allergic encephalitis. The investigators also have preliminary unpublished data on MCP1 in allergic asthma.\n\nThis background provides the sound rationale for a phase II, biomarker-driven, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\n1. To measure the effect of RNS60 treatment on selected pharmacodynamic biomarkers in ALS patients concurrently treated with riluzole. Candidate markers include 1. T-reg (measured via FOXP3 and CD25 mRNA); 2. Cyp-A; 3. 3-NT; 4. Actin-NT; 5. MCP-1; 6. IL-17.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nThe preliminary efficacy of RNS60 on functional disability, as measured by the ALSFRS-R scale;\nThe preliminary efficacy of RNS60 in prolonging survival (or time to tracheostomy, whichever comes first);\nThe preliminary efficacy of RNS60 in slowing the decline of forced vital capacity (FVC) from baseline;\nThe tolerability and safety of RNS60 through the identification of unexpected adverse events;\nThe impact of RNS60 on quality of life as measured by ALSAQ-40 scale.\n\nRNS60 has been tested in three Phase I safety studies in the USA (NCT01264783, NCT01057498, and NCT01511302), and a recently completed Phase IIa (NCT02422121) study in UK. Two additional investigator initiated Phase IIa trials are currently ongoing, one at Mass General Hospital (NCT02525471), and one at the University of Zurich (with University of Innsbruck as a second site). The choice of measuring both biological and clinical markers of disease in the same study reflects the attempt to accurately capture the complete clinical impact of RNS60 treatment. If both the biomarker results and clinical measures of the study support the purported efficacy of the drug, a follow-up study (or studies) will be designed to confirm the efficacy of RNS60 in a larger patient population. It is also possible that this study may result in promising biomarker findings but null clinical findings. If this were the case, more dose-finding work would be necessary before ruling out a possible clinical effect. Conversely, positive clinical findings accompanied by negative biomarker findings may necessitate the identification of new biomarkers of target engagement to further guide the drug development process.",

The product under evaluation will be administered to patients receiving the standard of care for ALS, including riluzole.\n\nRiluzole dosage (50 mg bid) must be stable and well tolerated for at least one month prior to inclusion into the study.\n\nAfter the double-blind period, open-label administration of TRO19622 will be allowed for safety and survival assessments and until efficacy results are available.\n\nA separate open-label protocol will be written 6 months after the randomization of the last patient into the study.",

Each investigational product will be tested in a regimen. Each regimen consists of a placebo-controlled trial, meaning that the active investigational product and matching placebo will be tested in each regimen.\n\nThe additional details that govern the testing of each investigational product will be summarized in separate regimen-specific appendices (RSAs). Each regimen will have a separate ClinicalTrials.gov posting, which will include specific information about the regimen. All regimen-specific outcome measures will be detailed in each regimen posting.\n\nParticipants will have an equal chance to be randomized to all regimens that are active at the time of screening. Once randomized to a regimen, participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either study drug or placebo.\n\nThe following regimens are active in the trial:\n\nRegimen A - Zilucoplan Regimen B - Verdiperstat Regimen C - CNM-Au8 Regimen D - Priodopidine\n\nNew regimens will be continuously added as new investigational products become available. The HEALEY ALS Platform Trial will enroll additional participants as each new regimen is available.",

        "brief_summary": "In the last years research has pointed out potential mechanisms of pathogenesis in ALS including lack of degradation of abnormally accumulated proteins inside motor neurons, and an unbalanced function of the immune system leading to the prevalence of a neurotoxic function over neuroprotection. These two mechanisms contribute to ALS progression hence representing important therapeutic targets to modify disease expression.\n\nWith a phase II clinical trial the investigators aim to study the biological response in ALS treated with Rapamycin, to obtain predictive information for a larger study.\n\nEight Italian Centres will enroll 63 patients; treatment will be double blinded to patients and physicians, and will last 18 weeks.Follow up will be carried out for 36 months (total duration: 54 weeks).",
        "detailed_description": "This is a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial for people with ALS.\n\nThe aim is to study the biological and clinical effect of Rapamycin (in two different doses) in addition to Riluzole on ALS patients through comparison with patients treated with Riluzole and placebo.\n\nRapamycin has been shown to enhance proteins degradation, and this has been associated with beneficial effects in models of neurodegeneration. Its immunomodulatory effects are also well established, notably the ability to suppress inflammatory neurotoxic responses mediated by T cells. As ALS is characterized by heterogeneous pathology and protein accumulation, some patients may respond to therapies that accelerate the clearance of abnormally accumulated proteic aggregates, while suppressing neurotoxic immune elements.\n\nSubjects will be enrolled in 3 groups of 21 subjects; treatment will be double blinded to patients and physicians, and will last 18 weeks. Active treatment will include oral Rapamycin at different doses: Rapamycin 1mg/m2/day or Rapamycin 2mg/m2/day. Rapamycin will be administered at fast, in the morning, once a day. Rapamycin levels will be measured (HPLC) to avoid toxicity (>15 ng/ml), but treating neurologists will have no access to blood laboratory data. Dosages will be adjusted accordingly and sham adjustments will be done in the placebo Group too. Post-treatment follow up will be 36 weeks. Globally the study will lasts 24 months. To monitor adverse events, examination and routine laboratory work (cell count, lipids and protein profile, kidney and liver function, C reactive protein) will be performed before taking Rapamycin/placebo. Non-routine laboratory studies include quantification and characterization of Tregs, lymphocytes phenotype, mTOR (mammilian target of rapamycin) downstream pathway activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), inflammasome components in PBMC and proinflammatory cytokine production in monocytes, peripheral biomarkers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be taken at baseline and at week 18 to measure neurofilaments and to dose Rapamycin to understand whether sufficient levels of Rapamycin can be found in the central nervous system (CNS).",

In the first instance the trial will have 3 arms; drug 1, drug 2 and placebo (dummy drug). This allows the evaluation of drug 1 versus placebo and separately drug 2 versus placebo. Participants will be randomly allocated to either drug 1, drug 2 or placebo. Medicines being tested are already approved for use in other conditions.\n\nMND-SMART has an 'adaptive' design. This means medicines being studied can change according to emerging results. Treatments shown to be ineffective can be dropped and new drugs can be added over the duration of the study. This will allow many treatments, over time, to be efficiently and definitively evaluated.\n\nThe first medicines being tested have been selected following a rigorous process involving a systematic, unbiased, and comprehensive review of past clinical trials data, as well as information from pre-clinical research (studies in laboratories), for MND and other related neurodegenerative disorders. Drugs have been ranked for inclusion in MND-SMART by a group of independent MND experts according to set criteria. These include consideration of how the drugs work, their safety profiles, and the quality of previous studies.\n\nNew drugs will be selected for investigation in MND-SMART based on continuous review of constantly updated scientific evidence as well as findings from state-of-the-art human stem cell based drug discovery platforms.",

Randomization will occur in a 2:1 ratio (MN- 166: placebo).\n\nDuration of Treatment: Screening Phase: up to 3 months; Double-blind Phase: 6 months; Open-label Phase 6 months (for placebo subjects only); Follow-up Phase: 2 weeks after last dose.\n\nDuring treatment phase, subjects return to the clinic at Months 3 and 6 and will be telephoned by staff at Months 1,2,4, and 5 to collect information about side effects and new or concomitant medications.\n\nAll subjects (subjects who complete the Double-blind Phase and subjects who complete the Open-label Phase) or prematurely discontinue will return for a follow-up visit approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug to assess adverse event status and to document concomitant medications.\n\nSafety will be assessed by monitoring and recording all treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) including serious adverse events (SAEs) and discontinuations due to TEAEs. Additional assessments will include regular monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values, regular measurement of vital signs, ECGs, medical history, physical and neurological examinations.",

        "detailed_description": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Multiple lines of evidence have implicated oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of ALS. Urate (uric acid) is an endogenous antioxidant system, and urate may serve as a major defense against oxidative stress. Urate has emerged as a promising neuro-protectant and therapeutic target based on convergent epidemiological, laboratory, and clinical data in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Parkinson's disease (PD). In PD, urate elevation has been pursued as a potential therapy by administration of inosine, a urate precursor that is available as an over-the-counter supplement. Administration of inosine results in a predictable elevation of urate levels and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in PD.\n\nAnalysis of ALS databases revealed that higher urate levels are an independent predictor of slower progression and prolonged survival in ALS. However, whether elevating urate in people with ALS would result in better outcomes is unknown. As a first step towards development of inosine as a potential treatment for ALS, in this study we will test whether inosine administration in ALS is safe and correlates with changes in the levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress and damage (as biomarkers of the intended biological effect).\n\nThe primary outcome measures will be safety, as measured by adverse events and clinically meaningful changes in vital signs, physical examination, and standard clinical laboratory tests, and tolerability, defined as the ability of subjects to complete the entire 12-week study.\n\nThe secondary objective of the study is to quantify the effect of the treatment on biomarkers of oxidative damage and stress.\n\nAn exploratory objective of the study is to measure whether changes in these biomarkers are different in people with bulbar-onset ALS compared to people with limb-onset ALS.\n\nThis study will be conducted in people who meet the El Escorial criteria of possible, laboratory-supported probable, probable, or definite criteria for a diagnosis of ALS. At screening, eligible individuals must be at least 18 years old and must provide written informed consent prior to screening. Subjects on a stable dose of riluzole and those not taking riluzole, and women of child-bearing age at screening are eligible for inclusion as long as they meet specific protocol requirements.\n\nStudy participants will be administered oral inosine daily. The dose of inosine will be titrated to obtain serum urate levels of 7 - 8 mg/dL.\n\nStudy participants will remain on treatment until the Week 12 visit. Each participant will also have a Week 16 Follow-up Telephone Interview to assess for adverse events (AEs), changes in concomitant medications and to administer the ALSFRS-R.",

Enrollment will occur in stages. Initially 84 participants will be enrolled in the trial. An interim analysis using available data will occur after the 84th participant is enrolled. During this time, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) appointed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) may decide to stop the trial for efficacy or futility reasons or to stop enrollment and request that follow-up continue with the 84 participants already enrolled in the trial, or the DSMB may decide to continue enrollment.\n\nParticipants will be randomized to one of two arms of the study. Arm one will receive lithium and riluzole. Arm two will receive riluzole and placebo (an inactive substance). All participants will be receiving riluzole. After screening and randomization, participants will be followed every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks. Subsequent in-person visits will occur every 8 weeks with a final visit at week 52. Between in-person visits, telephone interviews will take place every 4 weeks to administer the Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) questionnaire. A follow-up telephone interview will occur at week 56 (off study medication) to review adverse events. The primary outcome measure is disease progression as measured by the ALSFRS-R questionnaire. Participants randomized to placebo whose disease progresses will be crossed over to lithium for the remaining period of the study (up to 52 weeks total).\n\nDuration of the study for participants is 56 weeks which includes 52 weeks of treatment and a followup telephone interview at week 56.",

        "detailed_description": "Excess free radicals, energy mishandling, excitotoxicity, activation of cell death pathways and inflammation likely all contribute to neurodegeneration in ALS. Past trials may have been negative in part because they tested single agents, usually influencing only one mechanism of cell death. Combinations of agents that affect different and multiple mechanisms of neurodegeneration may be necessary to reach meaningful outcomes in trials of ALS.\n\nThis trial has several unique features. First, it compares the neuroprotective potential of two combinations of agents that impact multiple mechanisms of cell death. The combinations of minocycline/creatine and celecoxib/creatine are the only agents that have had additive effects in the mouse model of ALS, reducing neurodegeneration and prolonging survival more than individual agents alone. Second, it uses an important new phase II selection trial design to determine which combination is superior. Not only does this trial test combination therapy, but there is no placebo, so everyone who enrolls in the trial will receive active treatment.\n\nMinocycline, creatine and celecoxib have been tested individually and have been shown to be safe in patients with ALS. This will be the first time human trials will be conducted with combinations of minocycline/creatine and celecoxib/creatine.\n\nWe will compare combinations of drugs in a phase II trial design to determine which combination is superior. If successful, this trial will lead directly to a phase III trial of the selected combination. If the design is found useful, this trial will lead to larger phase II selection trials assessing greater numbers of agents simultaneously, thereby improving the efficiency of drug screening in ALS.",

        "detailed_description": "This study is a Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study of CK-2017357 in patients with ALS. 36 to 72 patients will be randomized to one of six different treatment sequences. Each treatment sequence consists of three dosing periods; in each dosing period\u00b8 patients receive a single oral dose of placebo, 250 mg of CK-2017357, or 500 mg of CK-2017357. All six treatment sequences will enroll approximately the same number of patients. A washout period of at least 6 days (to a maximum of 10 days) will be employed between the doses for each patient. This study is designed to assess the effect of CK-2017357 on maximal voluntary muscle strength, on the development of fatigue at maximal and sub-maximal voluntary muscle contraction, and on selected pulmonary function parameters. The plasma concentration of CK-2017357 will be measured at selected time points after each of two single doses of CK-2017357 in men and women. The plasma concentration versus time data obtained in this study may be used to develop a population PK model and estimate inter-subject variability of PK parameters in this target patient population, in particular between male and female study patients.",

        "detailed_description": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Multiple lines of evidence have implicated oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of ALS. Urate (uric acid) is an endogenous antioxidant system, and urate may serve as a major defense against oxidative stress. Urate has emerged as a promising neuro-protectant and therapeutic target based on convergent epidemiological, laboratory, and clinical data in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Parkinson's disease (PD). In PD, urate elevation has been pursued as a potential therapy by administration of inosine, a urate precursor that is available as an over-the-counter supplement. Administration of inosine results in a predictable elevation of urate levels and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in PD.\n\nAnalysis of ALS databases revealed that higher urate levels are an independent predictor of slower progression and prolonged survival in ALS. However, whether elevating urate in people with ALS would result in better outcomes is unknown.\n\nThe Principal Investigator has recently concluded a Pilot Study of Inosine in ALS, which was a short, open label, single center study involving 25 subjects [NCT02288091]. The study assessed safety and feasibility of urate elevation in patients with ALS. The Principal Investigator is now pursuing a multi-center Phase II trial to assess the findings of the open label study with longer exposure time.",

This protein causes your cells to increase production of one of your own protein called vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF-A), which may improve the structure and function of nerves and muscles. In addition, there are changes in the levels of 28 additional proteins in your cells. These proteins function to promote the growth of cells, are structures in cells, help synthesize products, and affect immune cells, and some have unknown functions. This increase in your own VEGF proteins may protect and repair the damaged nerves and muscles caused by ALS.",

        "detailed_description": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons leading to muscle weakness.\n\nThe pathogenesis of ALS is unknown, but there is convincing evidence that several molecular mechanisms play a role. Previous studies investigated the role of the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) gene in ALS. Recent data suggest that SMN genotypes producing less SMN protein increase susceptibility and severity of ALS. This leads to the hypothesis that the clinical expression of ALS is influenced by the total SMN protein level in affected patients. In a population of ALS patients in the Netherlands we found that SMN genotypes producing less SMN protein appear to increase susceptibility and severity of ALS. It was shown that the HDAC inhibitor sodium valproate (SVP) increases levels of SMN protein in vitro. From these results and from data suggesting neuroprotective properties of SVP, it is hypothesised that SVP could extend survival of patients with ALS. In addition, sodium valproate significantly prolonged the disease duration in the animal model for ALS, the SOD1 transgenic mouse. Given that SVP is a FDA-approved compound with well-known pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles, it is an attractive candidate for a clinical trial in ALS patients.",

Following a screening period of up to four weeks, eligible subjects will be randomised (1:1) to receive IV placebo or 15 milligram (mg)/ kilogram (kg) IV ozanezumab every 2 weeks for a period of 48 weeks with a follow-up visit around 14 weeks after the last infusion. A total of approximately 294 eligible subjects will be randomised from approximately 37 centers worldwide. The primary objective is to assess the effect of ozanezumab on the physical function and survival of ALS subjects over a treatment period of 48 weeks. Function will be measured using the ALS Functional Rating Scale - Revised (ALSFRS-R). Secondary objectives include the evaluation of other clinical outcomes associated with ALS (respiratory function, muscle strength, progression free survival and overall survival) in support of the primary objective. Quality of life, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (ozanezumab and riluzole) will also be assessed.",

        "brief_summary": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neuromuscular disease that results in rapid decline in normal muscle function and tone leading to difficulties with mobility, eating, drinking, breathing, sleeping, and communicating. The disease is progressive and no cure currently exists. Most people diagnosed with ALS succumb within 3 to 5 years. The only approved treatment to slow the progression of ALS is called Rilutek\u00ae (riluzole) which has only a modest effect and has been shown to increase survival by a few months.\n\nMuscular dysfunction present in people with ALS is caused by nerve breakdown and a dysfunction in the communication between the muscles and the nerves. The area where these communications occur is called the neuromuscular junction. Some recent studies have focused on using different medications to enhance communication at the neuromuscular junction with the goal of improving muscle function as a result. This approach is unproven but may help to slow the progression of the disease.\n\nPimozide is a medication that has been demonstrated to enhance communication at the neuromuscular junction in fish and mice. This study will look at whether Pimozide may help to slow the progression of ALS and how much medication needs to be taken to have an effect.",
        "detailed_description": "This clinical trial has two components: an acute therapy component consisting of a Phase II placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized-controlled pilot study of pimozide for the treatment of ALS; and a second component featuring a longitudinal follow-up study on ALS progression and outcomes. This clinical trial is registry-based including subject recruitment facilitated by the Canadian Neuromuscular Disease Registry (CNDR; National Principal Investigator: L. Korngut), and longitudinal follow-up data collection will occur during the second component of this clinical trial through the CNDR.\n\nThe acute therapy study duration for each subject is around 11 weeks. The follow up study duration through the CNDR is up to 5 years.\n\nNumber of study participants:25\n\nRandomization: Subjects will be block randomized with a block size of five subjects. Within each block one subject will be randomly assigned to placebo with the remaining four subjects randomized to the treatment groups. Study physicians will be blinded to patient randomization status. Randomization will occur with a 4:1 ratio of study drug (20 subjects) to placebo (5 subjects). After administration of maximum dose for 45-50 days, subjects will taper the allocated treatment or placebo. Randomization will occur via permuted block randomization and study personnel will be blinded to the randomization at all times allowing full concealment.",

The study had three phases: an open-label phase (2 weeks), a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase (48 weeks), and a double-blind, placebo-controlled tirasemtiv withdrawal phase (4 weeks). Patients who completed 2 weeks of treatment with open-label tirasemtiv (125 mg twice daily) were randomized 3:2:2:2 to placebo or one of three dose levels of tirasemtiv (250 mg/day, 375 mg/day, or 500 mg/day). Approximately 600 patients were planned to be enrolled into the open-label treatment phase.\n\nPatients taking riluzole at study entry could continue use of riluzole during the study as long as they had been on a stable dose for at least 30 days prior to study screening. In addition, for patients randomized to tirasemtiv, the riluzole dose was reduced to half the approved dose (ie, reduced to 50 mg once daily) because administration of tirasemtiv approximately doubles the exposure to concomitant riluzole. Patients randomized to placebo continued riluzole at 50 mg twice daily. This was accomplished without unmasking the study's blind as follows:\n\nAll patients on riluzole took their morning 50 mg dose of riluzole from their personal riluzole supply.\nThe sponsor supplied the evening riluzole dose as double-blind study medication, as follows: (a) for patients randomized to placebo, the double-blind, evening riluzole dose was 50 mg of active riluzole; (b) for patients randomized to tirasemtiv, the double-blind, evening riluzole dose was a matching placebo for riluzole.",

The HEALEY ALS Platform Trial Master Protocol is registered as NCT04297683.\n\nOnce a participant enrolls into the Master Protocol and meets all eligibility criteria, the participant will be eligible to be randomized into any currently enrolling regimen. All participants will have an equal chance of being randomized to any currently enrolling regimen.\n\nIf a participant is randomized to Regimen D Pridopidine, the participant will complete a screening visit to assess additional Regimen D eligibility criteria. Once Regimen D eligibility criteria are confirmed, participants will complete a baseline assessment and be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either active pridopidine or matching placebo.\n\nRegimen D will enroll by invitation, as participants may not choose to enroll in Regimen D. Participants must first enroll into the Master Protocol and be eligible to participate in the Master Protocol before being able to be randomly assigned to Regimen D.\n\nFor a list of enrolling sites, please see the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial Master Protocol under NCT04297683.",

        "brief_summary": "GM604 is an endogenous human embryonic stage neural regulatory and signaling peptide that controls the development, monitoring and correction of the human nervous system. Neurological diseases are multisystem, multifactorial, and single target drugs are ineffective. Genervon's Master Regulators play a significant role in embryonic/fetal nervous system development and are potent disease modification drug candidates modulating many pathways including inflammation, apoptotic, and hypoxia. The study drug is an regulatory peptide with a sequence identical to one of the active sites of human Motoneuronotrophic Factor and is manufactured by solid phase synthesis. Pre-clinical research indicates it to be a neuro-protective agent in animal models of ALS, motorneuron diseases, PD, other neuro-degenerative diseases and stroke. GM604 controls and modulates over many known and significant ALS genes with positive effects interactively and dynamically through multiple pathways, and up to twenty-two biological processes, including neuro-protection, neurogenesis, neural development, neuronal signaling, neural transport, and other processes. GM6 is not a cocktail of drugs, but one master regulator peptide drug that functions through multiple pathways. Genervon hypothesized that studying the biomarkers of protein expressions of these ALS genes such as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and the protein expression of substances such as tau, neurofilament - heavy (NF-H), Cystatin C which were indications of degeneration of neuron in the CSF collected from ALS patients will provide information of the possible GM604's mechanisms of action in treating ALS. 1.

        "detailed_description": "Background\n\nIn the early 1990s Genervon hypothesized that Central Nervous System / Peripheral Nervous systme (CNS/PNS) and rare motoneuron diseases and disorders involve the interplay of a highly complex, multifactorial process of many non-dominant effectors in an interactive dynamic network. Therefore Genervon decided for its drug development strategy the classic single target drug development paradigm is not likely leading to a cure.\nGenervon also hypothesized that aging is likely the initial multifactorial triggers that lead to multiple defective or degraded gene products accumulating with advancing years. However the key to a cure for many human neurological disorders is in the subsequent common terminal cascade coinciding with the onset of neurological deficits. The terminal cascade involves the shared pathways of interactive multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms that lead to the ultimate demise of neurons. Therefore Genervon's strategy is not to find the triggers or the residue debris of neuron death in discrete areas of the central nervous system.\nGenervon recognized the limited human capacity to design a drug that can dynamically and interactively modulate multiple pathways and genes. Therefore one possible drug development strategy is to find the endogenous early stage regulatory molecule(s) that controls the development, monitoring and correction of the human nervous system.\nGenervon developed a novel proprietary technology platform named Protein Bands Selection by Function to find the fetal signal regulators. One of the discoveries is a 33 amino acid peptide we named human Motoneuronotrophic Factor (MNTF), its gene sequence and its chromosome location.\nGenervon developed another novel platform named In Silico Analysis to find active sites within bigger proteins. Within the MNTF peptide, Genervon identified a family of nine embryonic stage human multifactorial master regulators which govern nervous system development, protection and correction. These master regulators are highly expressed in week 9 of embryonic/fetal development, a time of incredible intricacies, but truly remarkable consistency as well.\nGenervon has developed one of the nine master regulators named GM6 for disease modification of CNS/PNS and neurodegenerative diseases and disorders with shared or common pathways of interactive multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms. GM6 binds to Insulin Receptor beta sub-unit and Insulin Growth Factor Receptor 1 and Receptor 2 (IGF1R/IGF2R) which also have the identical sub-unit. GM6 penetrates the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) and activates many appropriate genes through multiple pathways to induce anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative and regenerative effects in response to the dynamic distress signals from the nervous system.\nGM6 is also known as GM604, GM602 and GM608. Drug name GM604 is assigned to ALS indication. GM602 is assigned to stroke indication. GM608 is assigned to Parkinson Disease indication.\nThe investigational drug GM604 is a regulatory/signaling peptide with a sequence identical to one of the nine active sites of human Motoneuronotrophic factor (MNTF), also referred to as GM6 in studies. MNTF is a novel human endogenous developmental stage neurotrophin for the nervous system with a specific human chromosome location.\nPre-clinical efficacy studies: The investigators' preclinical animal study has shown that intravenously injected GM604 is able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain. GM604 has shown neuroprotection in a variety of in vitro and animal models of numerous CNS diseases including ALS, ischemic stroke, spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer Disease (AD) and Huntington Disease (HD).\nGM6 provided neuroprotection for neurons in vitro against soluble inflammatory factors in human CSF from patients with various CNS diseases. It increased neurons survival by 175% after exposure to ALS patients' CSF, by 191% in AD patients' CSF, by 198% in PD patients' CSF, by 205% in Stroke patients' CSF, by 246% in MS patients' CSF and by 273% in HD patients' CSF.\nPreclinical research in animal models indicates GM604 to be a neuroprotective agent in animal models of ALS, motoneuron disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke. In ALS model, SOD1 mice from Jackson Lab stock #G93A were treated with GM604 at 0, 1 and 5 mg/kg. SOD1 mice were examined for age of disease onset, age of death, and behavioral expression of the disease (CS=Clinical score). GM604 prolonged life span in ALS mice SOD1 by 30% [(163.5-126)/126 = 30%], delayed median clinical score by 53%, delayed symptoms onset by 27% [(145.5-114.5)/114.5 = 27%] at 5 mg/kg dose. The conclusion is that GM6 significantly showed a dose dependent effect in delaying age of onset of the disease, age of death, increasing grip strength and rota-rod performance, and improving clinical score of the treated animals.\nThe investigators found out later in the study of Wobbler Mouse model that the optimal dose for SOD1 mice model should probably be 20 mg/kg and will probably see even more significant effects if 20 mg/kg were used in the SOD1 mice study.\nGM604 20mg/kg dramatically increased the survival life span by 500% (6 fold from 7-14 weeks to 55-65 weeks) and the control animals and animals treated with low doses of GM6 showed a continual decrease in grip strength. Wobbler mice treated with GM6 at 10-20 mg/kg showed an improvement in grip strength out to 4 weeks (3 fold). GM604 10 and 20 mg/kg treatment showed a significant increase in body weight out to 8 weeks following treatment.GM604 10 and 20 mg/kg treatment increased of preservation of motor neurons by 160% (2.6 fold).\n\nThe conclusion is that GM604 was found to be efficacious in an in vivo mouse model of neurological disease. The effectiveness of GM604 was dose-dependent and indicates that GM604 may be beneficial in treating various neurological disorders.\n\nRationales\n\nThis pilot trial is designed to test proof of principle, i.e. determine if a 2-week IV bolus treatment with this agent can (1) change ALS protein expression (target biomarkers and efficacy biomarkers) after treatment (2) have preliminary effects measures of ALS disease clinical progression.\nPrevious human experience: A Phase 1 Clinical Trial Study has been completed. The Phase 1 Trial primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability and to establish the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of GM602 at 0.5, 1.5, and 5.0 mg/kg administered as a single bolus intravenous dose in human subjects and after 3 consecutive daily doses of GM602 at the highest safe and tolerated dose of 5.0 mg/kg. The Phase 1 study established that 3 consecutive daily doses of 5.0 mg/kg of GM602 are safe and tolerated.\nConcurrently, other Investigational New Drug (IND) and on-going clinical trials with GM6 are:\n\nIND 77,789: \"A Phase 2 double blinded, randomized, placebo controlled dose escalation Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and the Safety of GM602 in Patients with Acute Middle Cerebral Artery Ischemic Stroke within an 18 h-hour treatment window. Acronym/Title is GMAIS. GM602 received fast track designation for ischemic stroke in 2007. The stroke trial has not completed enrollment and has not unblinded the treatment randomization to generate drug related safety report.\n\nIND 109,441: \"GM602 in A Phase IIA Pilot double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled trial in mild to moderate Parkinson Disease (PD). Acronym/Title is GAP-PD. The PD trial is recruiting patients.\n\nPossible GM604 Mechanisms of Action (MOA) in ALS\n\nMore and more scientists are publishing papers advocating that ALS is a multifactorial disease. Other rare diseases including CNS/PNS diseases and disorders are multifactorial and multisystem diseases as well, i.e. multiple interactive biologic systems and genes are compromised and failing like domino.\nOne of the major reasons for CNS clinical trials that have uniformly failed is that the classic drug development paradigm of designing single target drug for CNS/PNS and rare diseases' pathogenesis simply would not be able to handle the multifactorial nature of the complex diseases.\nAn initial trigger(s) which is likely to be multifactorial and cumulative is followed by a terminal cascade which also involves interactive multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms, coinciding with the onset of neurological deficits, genes mutation and or expression of misfolded proteins. That is simply why a single target drug is not able to do the job. Most neurological diseases and disorders have common underlying pathogenic mechanisms that lead to neural death. Our drug development strategy is to find an endogenous regulator to interactively and dynamically modulate these common underlying pathogenic mechanisms.\nGenervon changed the drug development paradigm from hitting a single gene/pathway to a comprehensive and dynamic, multifactorial approach to treat complex rare and neurodegenerative diseases with a multi-factorial drug GM604. GM604 is one of the embryonic/fetal stage MNTF master regulators that is an endogenous signaling peptide for the development and regulations of the nervous system development. GM604 is multifactorial and corrects inadvertent errors in embryonic/fetal development and this neuroprotection and correction property may be applied to neurodegenerative disease therapy in adults.\nGenervon studied the mechanisms of action of GM6 by DNA microarray technique. GM604 controls and modulates many known and significant ALS genes with positive effects, through multiple pathways interactively, systemically and dynamically. Our master regulator peptide drug modulates not just one but many ALS related genes. It is not a cocktail of drugs, but one master regulator peptide drug.\nMechanisms that have been postulated in ALS are a complex interplay between multiple pathogenic processes including oxidative stress, protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction excitotoxicity, and impaired axonal transport. GM604 modulates genes involved in these pathways and others. Genervon has also identified some genes to be tested as targets.\nALS is notoriously fatal and has many alternate forms with different pathogenesis. Therefore all the previous single target drug trials have to restrict the enrollment to very small selective segment of ALS patients. With the potential that GM604 functions through multiple pathways and modulate multiple ALS related genes, Genervon believes GM604 can potentially treat ALS patients from a variety of segments instead of restricting to small selective segment of ALS patients. Genervon is proposing an ALS Phase 2 clinical trial that is broadly inclusive.\n\nUse of Biomarkers for ALS\n\nMost late-phase clinical trials across all diseases fail to demonstrate drug efficacy between case and controls. The incorporation of biomarkers within clinical trials may reduce this 'drug attrition' rate. The biomarkers to be incorporated into clinical trials can be subdivided into:\n\n'Target' biomarkers (the drug hits its target and, therefore, provide benefit),\n'Efficacy' biomarkers (indicators of positive drug effect (result) via the mechanism of drug action).\n'Efficacy/Target biomarkers.\n\nGenervon hypothesized that modulating disease causing genes may modulate ALS disease progression.",

Disease progression leads to death within 2-4 years, but there exists no definite treatment so far.\n\nBased on phase I/II clinical trial(NCT01363401), twice intrathecal autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Lenzumestrocel) injections showed significant therapeutic benefit lasting at least six months with safety in patients with ALS.\n\nAdditionally, the switch from pro- to anti-inflammatory conditions, which was indicated from the inverse correlation between TGF-\u03b21 and MCP-1 levels after Lenzumestrocel injections in the good responder, has been considered a plausible beneficial action mechanism.\n\nThis study is designed to investigate the following. First, to reconfirm and evaluate the long-term efficacy of twice injections (single cycle) of Lenzumestrocel, group 1 will receive a single cycle injection with a 26-day interval.\n\nSecond, to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of Lenzumestrocel repeated injections, group 2 will receive a single cycle injection a 26-day apart followed by three times injections every three-month interval.\n\nGroup 3 will receive comparator injections.",

Study participants will be followed for 2 years once enrolled. They will receive either placebo or the active IGF-I. Examinations will take place at approximately 6-month intervals.",
        "detailed_description": "The objective of this trial was to determine whether IGF-1 (MyotrophinTM) slows progression of weakness in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Three hundred thirty patients with ALS from 20 medical centers participated in this double blind, placebo-controlled two-year study. Half the patients received IGF-1 and the other half received placebo. The drug will be administered twice a day.\n\nALS is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness and loss of motor neurons. IGF-1 is a neurotrophic factor essential for normal development of the nervous system and shows protection of motor neurons in animal models and cell culture systems. It is thought to block cell death pathways and promote muscle re-innervation and axonal growth and regeneration.",

        "brief_summary": "Tau, a protein in the cerebrospinal fluid CSF is believed to be elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. The investigators believe that Tau is truly a marker of increased neuronal death from any disease process. It is been shown that Memantine can inhibit and reverse the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of Tau and therefore the investigators are looking at the efficacy of Memantine at 10 mg twice a day (BID) to see if disease progression correlates with possible changes in Tau in ALS patients based on ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) scores.",
        "detailed_description": "We have been very interested in the role of developing a more active anti-excitotoxic cocktail for patients with ALS. As part of this interest we have been investigating potential markers for disease progression. One of our candidate markers has been the presence of elevated levels of TAU in the CSF of patients with ALS. While the presence of Tau was originally described as being used for adjunctive diagnostic testing in patients with Alzheimer's disease it has become clear that many neurodegenerative diseases possess elevated levels of Tau in the CSF. Therefore Tau is truly a marker of increased neuronal death from any disease process.\n\nWhile levels of Tau have not been studied in depth in ALS, there was one report in 2003 which showed that 70% of ALS patients have elevated levels of Tau in their CSF (Sussmuth et al). We have also collected a series of 24 patients with clinically definite ALS and found that 22 of them had elevated levels of Tau at the time of diagnosis.\n\nWe have been intrigued by the findings that Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, can inhibit and reverse the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of Tau which leads to sequestration of the normal Tau microtubules as well as microtubule associated protein 1 (MAP-1) and MAP-2. Further, Memantine has been shown to block the disassembly of microtubules which follows the hyperphosphorylation if Tau (Li et al., 2004).\n\nWe have submitted for presentation to the International Motor Neuron Disease meeting in 2005 the data on two anecdotal cases of patients with ALS. These two patients were diagnosed with ALS on clinical and electrophysiological data and they were found to have elevated levels of Tau in their CSF at the time of diagnosis. Both patients were treated with Riluzole, as standard therapy, and with Memantine 10 mg BID for 6 months. After 6 months their disease course was clearly very slow. A repeat analysis of their CSF showed that levels of Tau had returned to normal.",

        "brief_summary": "The primary objective is to evaluate in ALS patients the regulatory T cell early response to two low-doses of IL-2 at 1 and 2 MIU per day after one course of 5 consecutive days comparatively to placebo.",
        "detailed_description": "This is a phase II study on ld-IL-2 as a therapeutic agent for ALS which aims at defining the activity and safety of a range a doses for subsequent use of the best dose in a phase II/III trial. For ethical reasons, ld-IL-2 must be tested as an add-on therapy to riluzole hence all patients will need to be treated with riluzole for at least three months prior to entry. A randomized (1:1:1), placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial will be carried out to assess ld-IL-2 activity on regulatory T cells and immuno-inflammatory markers in ALS patients treated for 3 months (5 days every four weeks repeated three times).\n\nThe secondary objectives of this study are:\n\nA. To evaluate maintenance of Tcell response after three repeated 5-day courses at one course every four weeks for 12 weeks.\n\nB. To evaluate the safety of ld-IL-2 therapy in an ALS population, with an overall follow-up of 6 months (up to 15 weeks after last administration); C. To evaluate functional changes throughout the study; D. To evaluate changes in other pre-defined blood cytology parameters, and a blood biomarker for axonal damage.",

        "brief_summary": "Arimoclomol is a small molecule that upregulates \"molecular chaperones\" in cells under stress. Arimoclomol extends survival by five weeks when given both pre-symptomatically and at disease onset in a mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1) transgenic mouse model of ALS. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects in other rat models of nerve damage. Molecular chaperone proteins are critical in the cellular response to stress and protein misfolding. Recent data suggest that the SOD1 mutation responsible for ALS in some patients with familial disease reduces the availability of a variety of molecular chaperones, and thus weakens their ability to respond to cellular stress. Protein misfolding and consequent aggregation may play a role in the pathogenesis of both the familial and sporadic forms of ALS. Therapeutic agents such as arimoclomol that improve cellular chaperone response to protein misfolding may be helpful in ALS.",
        "detailed_description": "This is a Phase 2b double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel-group study evaluating the safety and efficacy of arimoclomol (400 mg t.i.d.) compared to placebo. A safety lead-in phase will be employed to ensure the safety of all study volunteers.\n\nTier I (Safety Lead-in): During the enrollment period for the safety lead-in phase, 24 volunteers meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized at 4 investigative sites. These volunteers will have weekly visits during the first 4 weeks after starting treatment. Pharmacokinetics (PK) will be performed at various timepoints throughout these 4 weeks. After the initial 4 weeks of treatment, visits will continue at 4-week intervals up to Week 36, subsequently visits will occur every 8 weeks up to Week 68. A final visit will occur at Week 72. There will be a 28-day post study medication Follow-Up Telephone Call to assess medical status and adverse events.\n\nTier II: After the Tier I volunteers finish 4 weeks of treatment, their data will be reviewed by the IDMC and, if no serious safety issues are identified, the recommendation will be made to start the second enrollment period (Tier II). During Tier II enrollment, volunteers recruited from approximately 30 to 40 centers in the US and Canada will be randomized. After screening and randomization, volunteers will be followed every 4 weeks for 9 months. Subsequently visits will occur every 8 weeks up to Week 68, with interim Follow-Up Telephone Calls at Weeks 16, 24, and 32 and a final visit at Week 72. A Week 76 Follow-Up Telephone Call to assess medical status and adverse events will occur at 28 days post last dose of study medication.",

        "brief_summary": "The clinical primary hypothesis is that there will be a difference between a Cannabis Sativa extract and placebo in their effect on spasticity in Motor Neuron Disease (MND) patients with signs of involvement of the upper motor neuron (UMN) resulting in disabling spasticity.\n\nSecondary goals of the study are to evidence of improvement in other symptoms (in particular pain), and to show favourable trends on functionality measures. Finally, cannabis based drug safety and tolerability will be studied through vital parameters (including weight and pulmonary function) measurement, and analyzing ALS function rating scale progression slope hopefully, showing a slowing of the functional values decrease, owing to cannabis neuroprotective effects)",
        "detailed_description": "CANALS project has as a main objective to analyse the safety profile, tolerability and efficacy of a Cannabis Sativa (Sativex) derivative on patients affected by spasticity due to motor neuron disease.\n\nMuscular rigidity (or spasticity) is a symptom that affects many patients with motor neuron disease, concurring to reduce personal autonomy, patients' quality of life and can potentially cause secondary symptomatology (as pain or secondary muscular retractions). Currently available anti-spasticity drugs are often unsatisfactory and their pharmacological action can cause weakness as a secondary effect. There many arguments supporting the use of cannabinoid derivatives in motor neuron diseases. Cannabinoids receptor is expresses both in the brain and in the spinal cord. In animal models cannabinoids have an anti-spasticity effect. Moreover recent studies on ALS animal models demonstrated a neuroprotective effect of cannabinoids, including the preservation of the motor ability and a survival increase of the treated animals. Recently many clinical trials (some of them performed at the Neurological Division of San Raffaele Hospital) demonstrated cannabinoid efficacy on spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis patients. CAnnabinois would be able to reduce spasticity with no secondary weakness effect on treated patients. The results of these studies led to the drug approval in certain countries and by the European Community for the treatment of spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis.\n\nThe aim of this study is to analyze the safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of a Cannabis Sativa (Sativex) derivative on patients affected by spasticity due to motor neuron disease ( Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Primary Lateral Sclerosis). The study will be performed along 7 weeks. During the first week will be asked patients to note down in the clinical diary elements related to their symptomatology. Afterwards patients will be randomized in two groups: drug-treated and placebo treated. The study will be followed by a 6-weeks open-label phase during which all patients will receive the active drug (Phase B)",

Human, rodent and stem cell-based model studies support the hypothesis that neuronal hyperexcitability may contribute to neurodegeneration in both sporadic and familial ALS. The investigators are doing this research study to find out whether retigabine will reduce motor neuron excitability in people with ALS. the investigators will also determine whether the drug is tolerable and safe for patients with ALS.\n\nThe proposed study will determine how the potassium channel opener ezogabine (retigabine) affects neurophysiological measures of upper and lower motor neuron excitability in ALS patients as assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and threshold tracking nerve conduction studies (TTNCS), respectively. The study will include the recruitment of approximately 60 unmatched healthy control subjects for analysis of variability of the neurophysiological tests prior to recruitment of ALS subjects. There will also be 12 matched healthy control subjects, recruited at the same time as ALS subjects.",

        "brief_summary": "This study will examine the effectiveness of G-CSF in treating patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - a fatal neurological degenerative disease that causes adult-onset, progressive motor neurons loss in the spinal cord, brain stem and motor cortex. Patients develop progressive wasting and weakness of both upper and lower limbs, bulbar and respiratory muscles. Usually death from respiratory failure typically is within 3-5 years of diagnosis. Although there are various treatments for ALS, riluzole is the only approved treatment to delay the disease progression. G-CSF is an approved drug that is used to increase white blood cell counts. Moreover, G-CSF and its receptor are expressed by neurons. It acts anti-apoptosis by activating several protective pathways, stimulates neuronal differentiation of adult neural stem cells in the brain, and improves long-term recovery. G-CSF is a novel neurotrophic factor, and a highly attractive candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions such as ALS.\n\nPatients 18 to 65 years of age who have had mild to moderately severe ALS for 0.5 to 2 years of duration may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and possible review of medical records, physical examination, blood test, urine and stool analyses, electrocardiogram, electrophysiological examination, neurological imaging and, for women, a pregnancy test.\n\nParticipants will have drug therapy according to randomized number. One group receives G-CSF while other group receives placebo. All of the participants receive riluzole treatment. For the procedure, patients are given a medication to lessen anxiety and any discomfort. Patients receive drug injections every 3 months for 5 days. The G-CSF dosage is 5\u03bcg/kg/day. Physical examination and interview, Appel ALS scale and ALS-Functional Rating Scale will be done in 14, 28 days and 3, 6, 9, 12 months. Electrophysiological examination will be tested per 3 months. Blood samples will be collected on treat 5, 14, 28 days and 3, 6, 9, 12 months.",

Upon completion of the first treatment cohort, the Sponsor will select a single dose or two different doses for the subsequent second cohort from a pre-specified dosing selection plan based on the evaluation of the 31P-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (31P-MRS) changes versus baseline in the first cohort. Up to a total of two treatment cohorts may be studied (n=12 patients/cohort, total n=24 patients). All patients will receive daily oral treatment over twelve consecutive weeks during each cohort's Treatment Period.\n\nThere will be three study periods per treatment cohort:\n\nA four-week screening period (Screening Period); A twelve-week treatment period (Treatment Period); A four-week follow-up period (End-of-Study Assessment).\n\nThe primary study outcome, CNS metabolic changes, will be assessed based upon each patient's Week 12 study visit versus the pre-treatment baseline. The primary endpoint is the brain metabolic effects of treatment with CNM-Au8 as assessed by an improvement of 31P-MRS assessment of Brain Tissue Cellular Redox Potential defined by the measured tissue ratio of NAD+:NADH concentrations following 12 weeks of once daily treatment.",

        "brief_summary": "Charcot neuropathic osteoarthropathy (CNO) is a progressively destructive process resulting from significant peripheral neuropathy of almost any aetiology. Diabetes mellitus has emerged as the commonest cause of CNO.\n\nThe Charcot foot in diabetes poses many clinical challenges in its diagnosis and management. The lacuna primarily lies in delineation of its etio-pathogenesis and consequently in targeted treatment modalities. Although traditional approaches focus on neurotraumatic and neurovascular theories, these fail to explain all the features of CNO, hence, other hypotheses have been put forward.The current belief is that once the disease is triggered in a susceptible individual, it is mediated through a process of uncontrolled inflammation which, in turn, leads to osteolysis, fractures and joint destruction. Of these processes, the involvement of the receptor activator of nuclear factor- \u043aB (RANK) ligand /RANK/osteoprotegerin (OPG) system in the process of acute CNO is particularly appealing and suggests new pharmacological approaches.\n\nStandard modalities of treatment include offloading and casting. Although various trials have analysed the impact of medical agents including bisphosphonates, teriparatide and bone stimulation techniques, the results have been either inconclusive or not translated into clinical practice. Hence, there is no efficacious treatment of active CNO apart from the traditional offloading. In view of recent advances in understanding of the disease process, the target of intervention should, logically, be interruption of the inflammatory cascade and subsequent osteoclast resorption. Zoledronic acid is the most potent bisphosphonate that has been studied in clinical trials to date and has the distinctive profile of strong inhibitory activity on the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, essential for osteoclast function. Methylprednisolone conceivably has a potential benefit by offsetting the RANKL/OPG system involved. There have been conflicting reports with bisphophosphonates in active CNO and Zoledronic acid has been infrequently used despite being the most potent. Glucocorticoids including methylprednisolone have also not been systematically tried in this condition.\n\nWe hypothesise that targeting the inflammatory cascade with Methylprednisolone and osteoclast mediated damage by Zoledronic acid will address the basic etiopathogenesis of active CNO and may result in earlier resolution of the disease activity. The above mentioned hypothesis is hence, planned to be tested in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.",
        "detailed_description": "Charcot's neuroarthropathy has been identified since 1883, yet we have much to learn about the pathophysiology and evidence based treatment options. Active CNO is characterised by repetitive trauma leading to inflammation in an insensate foot. This includes polypeptide receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL) which triggers the synthesis of the nuclear transcription factor nuclear factor-kb (NF-kb), and this in turn stimulates the maturation of osteoclasts from osteoclast precursor cells. At the same time, NF-kb stimulates the production of the glycopeptide osteoprotegerin (OPG) from osteoblasts. This \"decoy receptor\" acts as an effective antagonist of RANKL . It has been suggested that this results in continual production of proinflammatory cytokines, RANKL, NF-kb, and osteoclasts, which in turn leads to continuing local osteolysis .This has adequately demonstrated by an increase in proinflammatory phenotypes of monocytes in those with active Charcot foot when compared with diabetic control subjects. Also osteoclasts generated in vitro in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor and RANKL from patients with active CN have been shown to be more aggressive and exhibit an increase in their resorptive activity compared with control subjects. Motor neuropathy contributes to altered structure of the foot with resultant abnormal loading. Finally, it is possible that peptides like calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) , which normally antagonizes the synthesis of RANKL, reduced due to neuropathy increase the RANKL expression. Diabetes may predispose to occurrence of CNO through a number of mechanisms. Apart from the presence of neuropathy and possible osteopenia, these include the effects of advanced glycation end products, reactive oxygen species, and oxidized lipids, which may all enhance the expression of RANKL in diabetes.\n\nThe average delay in the diagnosis of acute Charcot has been reported to be around 29 weeks. Common misdiagnoses include cellulitis, erysipelas, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), venous insufficiency, gout, pseudogout, acute inflammatory arthritis, fracture, sprain, tumor, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, Sudeck's atrophy, and rheumatoid arthritis. Delay in prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment results in progression of the pathology resulting in rigid osseous deformity of the foot increasing the risk of callus formation, ulceration, infection, and lower extremity amputation by 15- to 40-fold .With the propensity for misdiagnosis and high potential for progression to a rigid foot deformity, early recognition and prompt initiation of treatment is paramount.\n\nRadiographs are the primary initial imaging method for evaluation of the foot in suspected CNO. However, they may initially be normal or show subtle fractures and dislocations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a higher sensitivity that allows detection of subtle changes in the early stages of active CNO when X-rays could still be normal. MRI primarily images protons in fat and water and can depict anatomy and pathology in both soft tissue and bone in great detail because of its unique capability of differentiating tissues with high detail.\n\nTreatment of CNO is aimed at offloading the foot, treating bone disease, and preventing further foot fractures. Because of the various etiologies of increased local bone resorption and/or secondary osteoporosis in patients with CNO and limited randomized placebo-controlled trials in this area, treatment guidelines are largely based on professional opinion rather than the highest level of clinical evidence. Hence, there remains a dearth of evidence based medical management for Charcot neuroarthropathy. Offloading at the acute active stage of the Charcot foot is the most important management strategy and could arrest the progression to deformity. Ideally, the foot should be immobilized in an irremovable total contact cast (TCC), which is initially replaced at 3 days, then checked each week. Edema reduction is often remarkable in the first few weeks of treatment. The cast should be changed frequently to avoid \"pistoning\" as the edema subsides.\n\nHowever, It is important to take into consideration that TCC may actually have unfavorable consequences including unnatural stress patterns, increased instability, loss of muscle tone, proprioception and boe density.Also, they are not designed to affect the underlying physiological mechanisms that cause bone destruction.In this context, treatment by antiresorptive drugs emerges as an attractive option. Bone turnover in patients with active CNO is excessive, hence bisphosphonates, by inhibiting osteoclast mediated resorption, have an important role to play. However, there is little evidence to support their use at present.Both oral and intravenous bisphosphonates have been studied in the treatment of CNO in small randomized, double-blind, controlled trials or in retrospective controlled studies. Whatever the precise pathophysiological mechanism of CNO, bone resorption and osteoclastic hyperactivity is a major feature of the early acute stage of this condition and makes the use of bone-resorption-inhibiting agents such as bisphosphonates(BPs) a logical therapeutic approach. Theoretically, pharmacological treatment of CNO by BPs, which inhibit osteoclastic resorption and may have direct anti-inflammatory properties, might slow or even stop the bony destruction through its ability to cause macrophage apoptosis.\n\nSelby et al first reported the use of a BP in the treatment of CNO. They administered 30 mg pamidronate i.v.,followed by five infusions of pamidronate 60 mg every 2 weeks for 12 weeks in six patients with diabetes and acute CNO. The treatment was associated with improvement in local pain and a significant reduction in the activity of the CNO as measured by the decrease in the temperature of the affected foot, from 3.4\u00b10.7\u00b0C (mean\u00b1SE) to 1.0\u00b10.5\u00b0C (p 0.05). There was also a significant reduction in bone turnover as judged by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level, which fell by 25\u00b13% compared with initial values (p<0.001). Stansberry et al in 1999 reported a decrease in peak cutaneous blood flow in response to the infusion of 90 mg pamidronate i.v. over 24 h in 20 patients with diabetes and CNO, suggesting a anti-inflammatory action of pamidronate. In 1999, Young reported anecdotally two cases of diabetic acute CNO treated with i.v. infusions of pamidronate associated with immobilisation. After 3 months, the clinical outcome was judged favourable with a reduction in clinical signs and an absence of deformity. Pakarinen et al. in 2002 retrospectively analysed clinical records and X-rays of 36 feet with CNO from 1994 to 2000. Eighteen patients received BPP treatment (pamidronate 30-60 mg i.v. once a week for 6 weeks) and no complications were registered. There was no statistically significant difference in casting time between patients who received (11 weeks) and patients who did not receive (13 weeks) pamidronate. In this series, pamidronate infusions were used for selected individuals without any striking benefits or disadvantages. Clinically, treatment with BP was associated with a more rapid decrease in skin temperature, but this effect was not sustained. Effect on the pain differed among studies, with one showing improvement but another showing none.Pakarinen et al tried Zoledronic acid and reported that it did not reduce the duration of immobilization. Rather there was an increase in total time for casting in subjects treated with Zoledronic acid.Similar observations about longer time of immobilization with the use of BPs was reported in the the recent multicentric observational audit of acute diabetic CNO in the UK.\n\nRandomised trials looking into possible use of glucocorticoids in management of active CNO have not been undertaken, possibly because of only recent understanding of the role of acute inflammation triggering the osteolysis that characterizes CNO. Intravenous supra-pharmacological doses of corticosteroids have been used in various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions because they are cumulatively less toxic than sustained steroid treatment at lower quantitative dosage. Their action is supposed to be mediated through non-genomic actions within the cell. When corticosteroids are administered as pulses, an immediate profound anti-inflammatory effect is achieved, inflammatory damage is minimized , toxicity is low and there is no prolonged suppressive effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. But there are no randomized trials looking into the efficacy and potential benefit of methylprednisolone in CNO as of date.\n\nHence this trial was designed to compare the therapeutic efficacy and profiles of two well known agents Zoledronic acid (antiresorptive) and Methylprednisolone (anti-inflammatory) in patients of diabetes mellitus with active CNO of foot.",

        "brief_summary": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease of an inflammatory nature, which causes progressive muscle weakness associated with cognitive and behavioural disorders. Pathogenically, it is characterised by loss of oxidative control, excitotoxicity due to excess glutamate and intestinal dysbiosis. In the absence of curative treatment, the aim of the study is to assess the impact at a clinical level of the combination of liposomed polyphenols to improve their effectiveness, with the drug G04CB02 which shows great anti-ALS properties by Molecular Topology methodology. A prospective, longitudinal, mixed, analytical, experimental and double-blind study is proposed, with a population sample of 100 patients distributed randomly in 50 patients in the intervention group who will receive treatment for 6 months, and 50 patients in the control group who will receive a placebo for the same period. The assessment will be at time 0, and at 3 months and 6 months after treatment, with functional, cognitive and behavioural tests, and of the state of inflammation and oxidation; and at time 0 and 6 months, of the intestinal microbiota.",
        "detailed_description": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common neurodegenerative disease of an inflammatory nature among those affecting motor neurons, with a life expectancy of 3 to 5 years. It is characterised by the loss of motor neurons, and can be of the bulbar type when the pathology begins to affect the motor neurons located in the spinal bulb, or of the medullary type when it begins with a loss of strength and weakness in the extremities. Both types eventually lead to an affectation of both motor neurons that results in progressive paralysis of the voluntary muscles until the patient dies. In addition, the pathology presents cognitive and behavioural alterations. Specifically, deficits have been described in verbal fluency, memory, emotional processing or social cognition, which appear to be mainly associated with hypoperfusion of the prefrontal area or hypometabolism.\n\nPathogenically, ALS is characterised by an alteration in mitochondrial energy use at a neuronal level, mainly linked to a lower activity of the enzymes of the electron transport chain in the spinal cord. This alteration is a consequence of loss of oxidative control, excessive generation of oxidative free radicals, accumulation of neurofilaments, and excitotoxicity linked to an increase in the neurotransmitter glutamate.\n\nIn this respect, it has been suggested that bacterial dysbiosis, related to cognitive and behavioural worsening, could also contribute to this adverse neuroinflammatory state, having been associated with a greater risk of suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically in ALS, a variation in intestinal microbial composition has recently been observed, with an increased abundance of E. coli and enterobacteria, and a low abundance of total yeast, in patients suffering from ALS; and lower levels of non-butyrate producing bacteria needed to maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier, immune competition and energy metabolism. In contrast, increased Akkermansia muciniphila has been associated with higher levels of nicotinamide and improved disease symptoms in the animal model of the disease.\n\nThis evidence, associated with the lack of medical treatment to cure the disease, makes it necessary to look for new therapeutic alternatives of a non-pharmacological nature. These include the administration of effective antioxidants, which reverse the high oxidative stress and inflammation characteristic of the disease. This type of treatment (specifically the association of the antioxidants Pterostilbene and Nicotinamide riboside) has already been applied by our research group to patients with ALS, achieving significant clinical improvements such as: greater functional capacity, greater respiratory capacity, increased muscle strength and electrical activity in the upper and lower limbs, as well as an increase in the percentage of skeletal muscle associated with fat loss. In this sense, several polyphenols have also been tested in animal models, among which the activity shown by Resveratrol stands out, with a high antioxidant power and great neuroprotective capacity, which is associated with an increase in the expression and activation of SIRT1 and AMPK in the ventral part of the spinal cord after its administration. Both mediators promoted the normalization of autophage flow and, more importantly, increased mitochondrial biogenesis in SOD1-G93A mice. However, their beneficial effects are strongly limited by their low availability. This limitation can be overcome by administering Resveratrol and its natural analogues, incorporated in liposomes or nanoparticles, as this is the best option for guaranteeing stability and bioavailability, after administration and absorption of the antioxidant.\n\nMoreover, the effects of the polyphenol Curcumin have already been studied in ALS. In a paper by Chico et al, its effects were studied in ALS patients at doses of 600mg/day for 6 months. In this study they found that Curcumin generated a slight slowdown in the progression of the disease, improving aerobic metabolism and oxidative damage. Furthermore, the use of nanobiotechnology with Curcumin (80mg/day) in the treatment of ALS patients obtained positive results showing that nanocurcumin is safe and could improve the probability of survival as an additional treatment in these patients, especially those with existing bulbar symptoms. In short, the use of both antioxidants in liposome form improves the bioavailability and effects of both, and their liposome combination has already been successfully tested in vivo in prostate cancer patients.\n\nThese anti-ALS effects of the two molecules could be complemented by their action in improving the microbiota. To obtain the bioactive products of Curcumin, biotransformation by the human intestinal microflora is necessary; in a bidirectional manner, it has been demonstrated that Curcumin has beneficial effects on the intestinal microbiota by increasing the number of bacterial families such as: Prevotellaceae, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacilli, Bacteroidaceae and Rikenellaceae, and reducing the number of pro-inflammatory bacterial families such as: Enterobacteria and Enterococci. With regard to Resveratrol, as occurs with Curcumin, the intestinal microflora contributes to its metabolism; and also stands out in the increased production of anti-inflammatory bacteria of the Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium genera. In addition, it has been found to increase levels of the bacterium Akkermansia Muciniphila, which is associated with an improvement in the prognosis of the disease.\n\nFinally, the use of these two antioxidants in ALS would be combined synergistically by repositioning G04CB02, a drug selected after a molecular topology scan of more than 30,000 drugs from two databases: CMC and Drugbank. It is currently marketed for the treatment of different pathologies, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia. According to the in silico studies based on Molecular Topology carried out by Dr. G\u00e1lvez's team, a very promising anti-ALS effect has been identified for G04CB02, linked to the TDP-43 RNA mediator, among others. Drug design using molecular topology consists of applying topological descriptors to identify and describe, using a specific mathematical pattern, molecules and/or drugs related to a specific disease, in this case ALS. Using molecules with proven anti-ALS activity (Edaravone and Riluzole) and the TDP-43 RNA mediator, this mathematical pattern was identified and the databases mentioned above were traced with the aim of identifying drugs that share the same pattern and therefore have potential anti-ALS activity. In addition, considering the current shortage of effective treatments for ALS, other mathematical patterns related to anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective and analgesic activity were taken into account when selecting the G04CB02 candidate. To date, molecular topology has enabled the identification of new treatments for CNS diseases such as Alzheimer's, cancer and very recently SARS-Cov-2, among others.",

        "brief_summary": "The purpose of this research study is to find out whether the drug mexiletine will be effective in lowering motor neuron electrical activity in the brains and nerves in the arms of people with ALS. The investigators will also determine if there are any signs that the drug may slow down the progression of ALS and reduce muscle cramps and muscle twitching. This will be determined through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and threshold tracking nerve conduction studies (TTNCS). In this trial, the participants will be taking either 300mg/day of mexiletine, 600mg/day of mexiletine, or placebo (non-active study drug).",
        "detailed_description": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting primarily motor neurons, for which treatment designed to slow or arrest progression remains lacking. Mexiletine is a use-dependent sodium channel blocker that has been FDA-approved for decades for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and more recently to treat neuropathic pain in diabetic polyneuropathy. Mexiletine has been shown also to be protective of neurons following spinal cord, head injury, and cerebral ischemia, largely by blocking excitotoxicity. Based on previous studies, mexiletine appears to penetrate into the central nervous system at concentrations sufficient to confer significant protection. Recent unpublished studies in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Brown at the University of Massachusetts have also demonstrated that mexiletine ingestion in mice genetically engineered to express high levels of mutant cytosolic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) transgene prolongs survival in these animals. As mexiletine already has FDA-approval as an anti-arrhythmic agent, much is known about the pharmacology and safety of this drug in non-ALS patients. We anticipate that by excluding subjects with a known history of cardiac disease and with the known neuroprotectant properties of this medication, mexiletine is a good choice for further study in an ALS clinical trial.",

The study drugs (including placebo) will be administered at the study site by following the investigator's instructions to either perform blood sampling for pharmacokinetic evaluation or maximize the treatment compliance.\n\nThere will be 7 cohorts and subjects will be randomized into cohorts consisting of 8 subjects each (6 active and 2 placebo controls per cohort). Dose cohorts will be escalated sequentially from low to high dose (50 mg, BID; 100 mg, BID; 150 mg, BID; 225 mg, BID; 300 mg, BID; 400 mg, BID; 525 mg, BID) by following a modified Fibonacci sequence, and based on the decision of an independent DSMB at a set time point. Following all subjects of a cohort complete the safety and PK evaluation after receiving the last dose administration, a cohort at the next dose level will be launched if the DSMB does not identify significant safety concerns after reviewing safety data and PK profiles.",

        "detailed_description": "Previous studies into the Guamian ALS-Parkinson's Dementia complex has identified \u03b2-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), as a potential neurotoxin responsible for this disease. BMAA is a non-essential amino acid and is produced by a cyanobacterium which is present in all ecosystems. Subsequently several groups have identified high concentrations of BMAA in brain tissues of patients from North America and Europe with several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS, Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Diseases. It has been hypothesized that chronic intake of BMAA in the diet leads to mis-incorporation of the amino acid into brain proteins, where it produces slow neuronal damage and recent evidence has shown that BMAA is mis-incorporated into proteins in neuronal cell lines via seryl tRNA synthetase, thereby producing protein mis-folding and protein aggregates, leading to cell death. It has been demonstrated in mammalian neuronal cell cultures that exogenous L-serine could prevent the BMAA neurotoxin from being mis-incorporated into proteins, thereby preventing cell death and that very high doses of L-serine may compete with the transport of a number of non-essential amino acids across the blood-brain barrier via the y+ transporter. These findings have led us to believe that high doses of L-serine could possibly stop the mis-incorporation of BMAA into brain proteins which in turn would slow or even abate the progression of ALS. This study will determine the safety of different doses of L-serine given to ALS subjects at 0.5 gm twice daily (BID), 2.5gm BID, 7.5g BID or 15 grams BID for six months.",

        "brief_summary": "The preclinical rationale for tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) use in treating patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) stems from the demonstration of antioxidant, antiapoptotic and neuroprotective properties of TUDCA in the central nervous system (CNS), both in vitro and in vivo models.\n\nThis protocol is meant for assessing if the addition of TUDCA to the conventional therapy can improve the therapeutic outcome in patients affected by ALS.\n\nSafety will be assessed for all subjects, for the entire duration of the study. 30 patients affected by ALS with site of onset in the limbs will be recruited.\n\nAll enrolled subjects will continue receiving riluzole at the same regimen as before entering the trial. Based on an appropriate random code, subjects will be divided into two groups of equal size treated, after a lead-in period of 3 months, by oral route with TUDCA at the dose 2 g daily for 1 year or with identical placebo by oral route at the same dosing schedule, under double-blind conditions.\n\nEvery concomitant and/or supportive therapy will be admitted.\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n\nEfficacy. The proportion of responder patients in the two treatment groups was the primary outcome measure of the study. Responder patients were defined as those subjects showing an improvement of at least 15% in the ALSFRS-R (2) slope during the treatment period as compared to the lead-in period. This threshold was chosen based according to the consensus conference on designing and implementing clinical trials in ALS (3).\n\nOther parameters will include ALSFRS-R at study end, FVC%, the SF-36 quality of life rating scale, time to tracheotomy from starting of study medication dosing (if appropriate), survival Time from starting of study medication dosing (if appropriate), Medical Research Council scores for right and left muscle groups.\n\nSafety. Incidence, severity and type of adverse events; changes in clinical laboratory findings.",
        "detailed_description": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or motor neuron disease (MND), is a rapidly progressive, fatal neurodegenerative condition characterized by loss of upper and lower motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The terms ALS and MND are often used inter-changeably to cover the different clinical syndromes, which include upper and lower motor neuron disorder, progressive bulbar palsy, and pseudo-polyneuritic form.\n\nDegeneration of lower motor neurons (LMN) in the anterior horns of spinal cord and brainstem leads to progressive muscular atrophy and eventually to death within a few years due to respiratory insufficiency. During the course of the disease, the involvement of tongue and pharynx muscles causes swallowing impairment with marked drooling, need of parenteral or enteral feeding, and finally gastrostomy. Denervation of laryngeal muscles causes loss of speech. Cramps and fasciculation typically occur from the early phases of the disease. Degeneration of upper motor neurons (UMN) in the brain cortex causes pyramidal tract dysfunctions including clonus, Babinski sign, hypertonia, and loss of dexterity that further limit patients' daily activities.\n\nThe incidence of ALS varies from 0.2 to 2.5 cases per 100,000 per year, although estimates vary between countries, likely reflecting a combination of availability of medical services, diagnostic accuracy, and demo-graphic characteristics of the area. Increasing life expectancy and improvements in standards of treatment and care will also result in an increased incidence of ALS. Globally, the overall rate is approximately 2 per 100,000. Its prevalence is approximately of 7 per 100,000. In Italy, the reported incidence of ALS is 2.2 cases/100,000/year.\n\nThere is currently no cure for ALS. Despite initial positive results in preclinical and early clinical studies, large-scale clinical trials with all agents except riluzole failed to demonstrate a clinically meaningful therapeutic effect in patients with ALS. Riluzole at the dose of 100 mg/day showed a significant difference on survival (6.4%; gain of 3 months) and slowed deterioration in muscle strength.\n\nPrimary involvement of apoptotic mechanisms has important implications in selecting drug candidates for therapy in ALS. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated that TUCA is endowed with antioxidant, antiapoptotic and neuroprotective activities. In particular, TUDCA can cross the blood-brain-barrier and has been shown to exert a significant therapeutic effect in a model of HD mice.\n\nTauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a hydrophilic bile acid that is normally produced endogenously in humans at very low levels. TUDCA is synthesized in the liver by conjugation of taurine to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), which is commonly used as a bile acid replacement therapy for the treatment of certain cholestatic syndromes.\n\nThe main pharmacological activity of TUDCA consists in its ability in increasing the cholesterol solubilising activity of bile, thus transforming \"lithogenic\" bile in \"non-lithogenic\" or \"litholytic\" bile.\n\nTUDCA inhibits mitochondrial-associated apoptosis via many pathways: 1) it inhibits the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and cytochrome C release, 2) it inhibits mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and 3) it antagonizes Bax translocation from the mitochondria and caspase activation in hepatocytes and brain. TUDCA may also ease oxidative stress.Study relevant TUDCA pharmacology consists in its antioxidant, antiapoptotic and neuroprotective activities evidenced in preclinical studies.\n\nRecent reports have shown that hydrophilic bile acids, such as UDCA and TUDCA, can prevent hepatic cytotoxicity through several mechanisms. For example, TUDCA prevents the production of reactive oxygen species and thus acts as an antioxidant. Additionally, TUDCA mitigates mitochondrial insufficiency and toxicity, and prevents apoptosis, in part, by inhibiting Bax translocation from cytosol to the mitochondria. In hepatocytes, this inhibition results in reduced mitochondrial membrane perturbation, release of cytochrome c, and activation of downstream caspases. TUDCA reduced cytotoxicity in neurons through similar mechanisms, as well as mitochondrial pathways that are independent of the permeability transition. TUDCA prevented striatal degeneration and ameliorated locomotor and cognitive deficits in the in vivo 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) rat model of HD. Intracellular inclusions were significantly reduced, and the TUDCA-treated mice showed improved locomotor and sensorimotor abilities.\n\nIn addition, the antiapoptotic and cytoprotective effects of TUDCA have been tested in models of acute stroke. The possibility that TUDCA exerts an antiapoptotic action by ameliorating mitochondrial function raises the issue whether other neurological disorders, including Friedreich's ataxia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, can benefit by the administration of TUDCA. This drug is a candidate neuroprotective agent for a variety of chronic neurodegenerative conditions.",

Subjects are required to stay in the Clinic for approximately 9 hours following the first and last dose. Subjects will also have a mid-week clinic visit and will be contacted by phone within 3 to 5 days after the last dose.\n\nFunding Source - FDA OOPD",
        "detailed_description": "Primary objective: to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of orally administered CC100 in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Secondary objectives: to determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CC100 in plasma after single and after multiple doses; and to determine short-term effects of CC100 on potential blood-cell ALS biomarkers.\n\nStudy Design: Phase 1 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multiple-dose of three CC100-dose cohorts. Approximately 18 subjects will receive CC100. Approximately 3 subjects will be randomized to placebo (across 3 cohorts). Periodic Assessment Committee safety reviews. Note: Participation will not exclude subjects from future CC100 studies Criteria for Evaluation: Safety Endpoints: Adverse events, blood chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs. Pharmacokinetic (PK)/Pharmacodynamic (PD): Plasma for CC100 concentrations (PK). Blood collected at baseline and after each subject's last dose will be assayed for potential biomarker(s). Stored specimens will be de-identified or combined for validating diagnostic tools/assays related to ALS. Statistical Methods: A minimum of 6 subjects per CC100 dose group and 3 placebo-dosed subjects (total across cohorts) are considered sufficient to evaluate initial safety and tolerability for the cohorts. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates will be calculated by standard noncompartmental methods of analysis. Absolute bioavailability of administration will be estimated based on the total area under the time- concentration curve (AUC0-\u221e).",

Although most of the trials showed a positive trend, none of them reached a statistically significant result. The only exception is the Riluzole trial, that demonstrated a small but significant reduction in mortality between treated and untreated patients. When administered to SOD-1 transgenic mice, IGF-I prolongs survival, ameliorates muscular strength, and reduces weight and motor neuron loss, astrocyte gliosis, and ubiquitin positive protein inclusions.\n\nTwo clinical trials have been performed in ALS patients with s.c. administration of IGF-I indicating a possible beneficial effect, and a third clinical trial is in progress. Methionyl growth hormone (mGH) showed no effect on survival, disease progression and muscular strength. MGH was administered at a fixed dose and peripheral production of IGF-I appeared to be normal. We propose a double-blind trial of Growth Hormone (GH) as add-on therapy to Riluzole, with an individually regulated dose based on the peripheral response of IGF-I. Aim of our study is to determine if the add-on of GH to treatment with Riluzole is able to reduce neuronal loss in the motor cortex of ALS patients. As secondary objectives, effect of GH on mortality, QoL, and motor function will be assessed.",

        "brief_summary": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common motor neuron disease, is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord leading to motor neuron death. It is a devastating disease of the anterior and lateral corticospinal tracts with approximately 3 years mean duration from symptoms onset to death, one-fifth survival at 5 years and only 10% may make it to 10 years.\n\nAmong the neuronal death pathways, excitotoxicity mechanism is considered to be the foremost-involved mechanism. AMPA receptors are thought to be the prime mediator of the fast excitation in spinal motor neurons, where they are expressed ubiquitously. AMPA receptor antagonist was able to prevent this acute degeneration in previous animal studies.\n\nThe investigators aim to study the tolerability and safety of the novel AMPA antagonist, perampanel, in patients diagnosed with ALS. Perampanel [2-(2-oxo-1-phenyl-5- pyridin-2-yl-1,2-dihydropyridin-3-yl) benzonitrile] with its selective non-competitive AMPA antagonism, was recently approved for epilepsy. Various long-term trials studying perampanel in epilepsy showed favorable tolerability profile and most common side effects were mainly: dizziness, headache and somnolence. All patients presenting to Neurology clinics at AUBMC diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, will be considered for the study. Investigators will obtain informed consents from all patients who agree to be enrolled in this study in accordance with institutional review board (IRB) requirements. Patients of both genders and over 18 years old who meet the El Escorial criteria for possible, probable or definite ALS and fit the inclusion criteria will be recruited. Subjects should not be started on riluzole for the past 30 days or stable on a dose of riluzole for at least 30 days prior to the screening process.\n\nIn titration phase, perampanel dose will be increase by 2mg/day increments every one week to reach a maximum dose of 8 mg/day; reaching the maximum dose in four weeks. Treatment phase will be followed by washout period during which, dose will be tapered by 2mg/day every 5 days (over total of 15 days).",

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects in other rat models of nerve damage. Molecular chaperone proteins are critical in the cellular response to stress and protein misfolding. Recent data suggest that the SOD1 mutation responsible for ALS in some patients with familial disease reduces the availability of a variety of molecular chaperones, and thus weakens their ability to respond to cellular stress. Protein misfolding and consequent aggregation may play a role in the pathogenesis of both the familial and sporadic forms of ALS. Therapeutic agents such as arimoclomol that improve cellular chaperone response to protein misfolding may be helpful in ALS.",

        "brief_summary": "This is a Phase 2a single-centre, open single-arm study in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) of intermediate progression rate. Eligible subjects will be administered weekly doses of ILB. A total of 5 subcutaneous (s.c.) doses will be administered at the study clinic.\n\nThe study consists of 10 visits; One 2-part screening visit, 5 ILB administration visits, and 3 follow-up visits. Each individual patient's study participation will be 4 months, including the screening and follow-up visits. Fifteen patients are planned to be included.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ILB in patients diagnosed with ALS.\n\nILB is a solution for subcutaneous (s.c.) injection in saline solution. The dose administered will depend on the subject's body weight at the second study visit, prior to the first ILB administration.\n\nNo formal sample size calculation has been performed for this study. The proposed sample size is considered sufficient in this early phase 2 development to provide adequate information on the patients. Categorical data will be presented as counts and percentages. Continuous data will be summarised using descriptive statistics.",

        "brief_summary": "The study evaluates the effects of two different Colchicine doses (0.01mg/kg/day or 0.005 mg/kg/day) compared to placebo in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients. Disease progression as defined by changes in ALSFRS-r is the primary outcome measure. Other measures of clinical progression and survival, together with safety and tolerability of Colchicine in ALS patients will be assessed.",
        "detailed_description": "Recent evidence supports the disruption of the ubiquitin-proteasome-system and autophagy as central events in ALS. ALS is characterized by the presence of misfolded proteins prone to oligomerize into aggregates, which exert a toxic effect by affecting several intracellular functions. Heat shock protein B8 (HSPB8) recognizes and promotes the autophagy-mediated removal of misfolded mutant SOD1 and TDP-43 fragments from ALS motor neurons (MNs). Moreover, HSPB8-BAG3-HSP70 maintains the so called \"granulostasis\", a surveillance mechanism that avoids the conversion of dynamic stress granules (SGs) into aggregation-prone assemblies, which are a hallmark of ALS.\n\nColchicine enhances the expression of HSPB8 and of several autophagy players while blocking TDP-43 accumulation in neurons. Moreover, given the cross-talk between infalmmation and autophagy, the well-known antinflammatory action of Cochicine may contribute to cell homeostasis.\n\nBased on these premises, this is a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter (9 MND Centres in Italy: 2 centres in Milan, Pavia, Turin, Modena, Padua, Rome, Naples, Bari), clinical trial to test efficacy of Colchicine in ALS.",

After the informed consent was signed, they were divided into a trial group and a control group. Each group contains 15 cases. The patients in the control group was treated with edaravone dissolved in saline during hospitalization, while the patients in the trial group was treated with edaravone, scopolamine, atropine and dexmedetomidine. Both groups of subjects were treated for 7 days within 3 weeks, followed by a buffer period of 3 weeks for observation, which was one treatment course. The total treatment protocol contains 3 treatment courses (or 18 weeks). Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were evaluated before treatment and 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 weeks after treatment. The observations include whether the functional scores of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Norris amyotrophic lateral sclerosis score, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis self-score, forced expiratory volume in one second, partial pressure of oxygen and maximum displacement of the hyoid were superior to those before treatment, and whether the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was inferior to those before treatment. Study hypothesis: Cholinergic receptor blocking therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is safe and effective in improving motor function and delaying disease progression in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

Abnormalities in creatine have been linked to the progression of degenerative neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's Disease). This study will test whether taking creatine can improve the symptoms of ALS.",

Currently there is no known cure and a specific cause has not been identified. Creatine is a nutritional supplement that improves mitochondrial function and has been shown to protect motor neurons in animal models of ALS. Preliminary research indicates that creatine may also improve strength in patients with ALS. This study will determine the effect of creatine treatment on short-term muscle strength and long-term muscle deterioration in patients with ALS.\n\nParticipants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either creatine or placebo. Participants will be enrolled in the study for 9 months. Quantitative muscle testing will be done weekly for the first 3 weeks; participants will then be followed monthly for the next 4 months and bimonthly for the remainder of the 9-month study. The study will also monitor purposeful exercise to determine if this enhances the benefit of creatine usage on muscle strength. Pulmonary function testing will accompany the muscle testing to determine if creatine strengthens respiratory muscles, thereby enhancing pulmonary function.",

Subjects who have been receiving riluzole since before the enrollment are allowed to continuously receive riluzole during the 12-week observation period (with the dosage remaining unchanged), and stop receiving riluzole from the beginning of the 1-week (acceptable window: 5-9 days) transitional period. After the completion of the transitional period, subjects whose total ALSFRS-R score decreased by 1 to 3 points during the 12-week observation period will receive bosutinib for 12 weeks to evaluate the safety and tolerability of bosutinib in ALS patients. All ALS drugs including riluzole will be prohibited during the bosutinib treatment period.\n\nIn this study, 3 to 6 ALS patients will be enrolled in each of the 4 bosutinib dose lelvels [100 mg/day (dose level 1), 200 mg/day (dose level 2), 300 mg/day (dose level 3), or 400mg/day (dose level 4)] to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational drug (bosutinib) under a 3+3 dose escalation study design. The dose will be escalated by 1 dose level at a time; no skipping will be allowed.\n\nDose escalation and MTD will be determined by the safety assessment committee comprising oncologist, hematologist, ALS Expert based on the incidence of DLT in 4 weeks of treatment among 3 subjects enrolled (6 subjects if additionaly enrolled) in each dose level. RP2D will be determined by the safety assessment committee upon completion of 12-week study treatment in all subjects in all dose levels.",

The autologous MSC-NTF cells are back-transplanted into the ALS patient into the sites of damage, the spinal cord and the muscles.\n\nNTFs are potent survival factors for embryonic, neonatal, and adult neurons and are considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS. Delivery of appropriate NTFs to the immediate environment of afflicted neurons in ALS patients is expected to improve their survival and thus slow down disease progression and alleviate symptoms.\n\nPrevious open-label clinical trials have shown that MSC-NTF cells treatment was well tolerated and appears to be generally safe. Some initials indications of clinical benefit were also observed in some patients.\n\nThis multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single combined intramuscular and intrathecal administration of MSC-NTF cells in early-stage ALS patients. Patients will be followed for approximately three months before transplantation with their autologous MSC-NTF cells or placebo. During this period of time, patient bone-marrow will be harvested and mesenchymal stromal cells will be isolated and expanded. Following treatment patients will be followed for a total of six months at monthly visits.",

        "detailed_description": "The primary objective of the study is to determine the acute safety and tolerability of oral administration of Gilenya (fingolimod) 0.5mg daily vs. matched oral placebo administered daily.\n\nThe primary outcome measure will be safety and tolerability; safety will be assessed by the occurrence of adverse events and clinically meaningful changes in vital signs, ophthalmologic examination, physical examination, electrocardiogram and standard clinical laboratory blood tests, and tolerability will be defined as the ability of subjects to complete the entire 4-week study.\n\nThe secondary outcome measure will be the measured effect of the treatment on circulating lymphocyte populations in patients with ALS.\n\nExploratory outcome measures will include the rate of decline of the ALS Functional Rating Scale (Revised) (ALSFRS-R) and Slow Vital Capacity (VC) during the course of treatment.\n\nThis study will be conducted in subjects who meet the El Escorial criteria of possible, laboratory-supported probable, probable, or definite criteria for a diagnosis of ALS. At screening, eligible subjects must be at least 18 years old, must have an SVC \u2265 65% of predicted capacity for age, height and gender, and must provide written informed consent prior to screening. Subjects on a stable dose of riluzole and those not taking riluzole, and women of child-bearing age at screening are eligible for inclusion as long as they meet specific protocol requirements.\n\nSubjects will remain on randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment until the Week 4 visit. Each randomized subject will also have a Week 8 Follow-up Telephone Interview to assess for adverse events (AEs), changes in concomitant medications and to administer the ALSFRS-R.",
