Cytokine Assay Plasma samples were measured using a multiplex immunoassay (Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Cytokine, Chemokine, and Growth Factor Assays, 23-plex, Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The measurement of the plasma samples of transgenic SOD1G93A mice (placebo n = 11 and RD2RD2 n = 11) and their non-transgenic littermates (ntg n = 7) was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. In general, values below the limit of detection (LoD) were excluded from analysis. The plasma samples were tested for several interleukins (IL-1 , IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40 and IL-17), interferon-  (INF- ), tumor necrosis factor-  (TNF- ) and several chemokines (C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL-2 and CCL-5) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL-1). Data corresponded to the concentration ranges of the multiplex immunoassay. Cytokine concentrations are given in picogram per millilitre (pg/mL).",

        "text": "5.3. Study Design Female SOD1G93A mice were treated daily p.o. with 50 mg/kg RD2RD2 or placebo (drinking water) formulated in tailor-made jellies as described in the section below. The RD2RD2 dosage was chosen based on successful former experiments with related compounds, taking the difference in molecular weight into account [41]. The RD2RD2 amount in the jellies was adjusted based on the weekly determined average body weights of the mice. The cohort of animals contained 42 female mice assigned into three experimental groups consisting of SOD1G93A mice (RD2RD2 n = 14 and placebo n = 14) and a control group of non-transgenic littermates (ntg n = 14). All animals born within one week were stratified into the treatment groups according to gene copy numbers and results of behavioural tests (SHIRPA test and pole test) at baseline. Each mouse was treated for 68 days and the average age at treatment initiation was 53 days \u00b1 2 days.  The anticipated treatment start was based on a previous pilot study in which transgenic SOD1*G93A mice were compared to their wild type littermates from week 4 until week 20 of age. Using the modified pole test, first measurable deficits in motor performance of transgenic mice were detected at an age of 8 weeks [44]. According to the criteria of Ohgomori et al. (2017) [71], the current study was designed to start in the pre-symptomatic phase, before first deficits are visible (7 weeks of age).  In regular intervals, SOD1G93A mice and their non-transgenic littermates were tested in different behavioural set ups (SHIRPA test battery, pole test, grip strength test and splay reflex test of hind limbs) starting before treatment (baseline measurements). The stratified randomisation of the transgenic mice into two equal groups was based on the following criteria: \u2206CT and baseline measurement of the SHIRPA and pole test. All tests were carried out at the same time of the day and all mice were habituated in single cages before starting the particular tests. Mice were observed daily for disease progression. At the end of the study, blood and tissue samples were collected of the SOD1G93A and non-transgenic mice. Blood samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant (plasma) was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Following blood collections, brains and spinal cords of SOD1G93A and non-transgenic mice were harvested and histologically analysed for gliosis (using an integrin \u03b1-M/\u03b2-2 (CD11b) antibody for activated microglia and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for activated astrocytes) and neurodegeneration (using an antibody against neuronal nuclear proteins (NeuN) for mature neurons and a choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) antibody for motor neurons). Plasma samples were biochemically analysed for several inflammatory markers using a multiplex immunoassay.",

Animals were housed in a 12-h light-dark cycle room with stable temperature (20 \u00b1 2 \u00baC) and humidity (55 \u00b1 5%). ALS animals aged 40 days were treated orally for 90 days with one of three daily doses of R13 (3.6 mg/kg (n = 9), 21.8 mg/kg (n = 10), or 43.6 mg/kg (n = 12), respectively) 24. Non-transgenic mice of gender-matched littermates (WT (n = 10)) or transgenic mice (n = 9) were treated with an equivalent volume of vehicle for 90 days. Animals were given behavioral tests when treated with R13 or vehicle for 80 days, and then terminally anesthetized. All animal experiments were performed according to the 'Policies on the Use of Animals and Humans in Neuroscience Research' revised and approved by the Society for Neuroscience (USA) in 1995, and the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology approved the study protocol.

Before pipetting together, all components were prewarmed for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Then, 5 \u03bcM dimeric hSOD1 was mixed with 5 \u03bcM ThT, 10 mM TCEP, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM sodium chloride, and the corresponding concentration of peptide (protein/peptide molar ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10 related to the monomeric concentration of hSOD1) in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 6. As controls, a sample with hSOD1 and without peptide and a sample without hSOD1 and with peptide were used. All prepared samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C without agitation.

        "text": "Cell Viability Assay. A cell viability assay using the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was performed to investigate the cytotoxicity of hSOD1 species that were previously incubated with and without S1VL-21 under aggregating conditions. Therefore, Neuro2a cells were cultivated in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. A total of 2500 cells per well in a volume of 100 \u03bcL were seeded on flat-bottomed 96-well plates (VWR, Radnor, USA) and incubated in a 95% humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C for 6 h. Aggregates of hSOD1 alone and hSOD1 incubated with increasing concentrations of S1VL-21 (1:1; 1:5; 1:10) under aggregating conditions were prepared as described in 0. The samples were collected after 65 h and centrifuged for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C and 100 000g. The supernatant was completely removed, whereas the pellet was dissolved in the same volume of cell culture medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin) and diluted to 1:1. Neuro2a cells were then treated with 30 \u03bcL of each sample and were further incubated for 3 days in a 95% humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. Cell viability was measured using the Cell Proliferation Kit I according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) in a 5-fold determination. The absorbance of the formazan product was determined by measuring the absorption at 570 nm subtracted by the absorbance at 690 nm in a microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). The results were normalized to the mean value of cells treated with medium only. As a positive control for cytotoxicity, 10% DMSO diluted in medium was used.",

        "text": "Animals Animal experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Kansas Medical Centre (KUMC). All experiments were performed in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of KUMC and the approved animal care and use protocol. The authors complied with the ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines. Male SOD1G93A mice with a C57Bl/6 J background (B6.Cg-Tg (SOD1*G93A) 1 Gur/J, the Jackson Laboratory stock number 004435, high copy number transgene) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and used in this study without breeding. The Jackson Laboratory confirms the transgene copy number using quantitative PCR (qPCR, the Jackson Laboratory technical information). There is no difference in survival between males and females in the B6 background. The incidence of human ALS is higher in males; thus, only male mice were analyzed in this study. The Guidelines for ALS preclinical animal research published based on the consensus meeting recommends using 12 or more animals of single-sex for survival analysis. Thus, twelve mice per group and a total of 36 singly housed male mice were analyzed. Purchased mice were randomized into three groups for the analysis. Controls were genotype-, age- and sex-matched mice. The end-stage of a lifespan was recorded when mice are unable to right themselves 30 s after having been pushed on their side based on the guidelines for preclinical studies using ALS mouse models.  Oxaloacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, #O7753) was reconstituted on the day of injection in PBS, adjusted to a final pH of 7.2 \u2013 7.4 with sodium hydroxide, filter sterilized, and injected into the mice as soon as possible. Oxaloacetate was administered by intraperitoneal injection, 2 g/kg body weight, with one injection per day for five days a week. The drug dose, injection method, and frequency are based on the successful outcomes of oxaloacetate administration in wild-type mice in our published study",

The neurological score scale (0\u20134) was used as suggested by the ALS Therapy Development Institute (Scott et al., 2008; Lincecum et al., 2010). Motor performance was assessed using a rotarod apparatus every three days, starting from 70 days of age. Mice were pretrained for 3 days (16 rpm, 3 trials) before the test. The time that a mouse stayed on the rod rotating at 16 rpm was recorded to evaluate the motor function. Three trials were performed, and the best result of the three trials was recorded with a maximum of 180 s (Knippenberg et al., 2010). Disease onset was reached when gait abnormalities were detected, or two successive instances of weight loss were detected, or when the mice were unable to stay on the rotarod for 180 s. A footprint test (n = 6 in each NTG group and n= 10 in each G93A group) was performed at the ages of 95 days (disease onset in most G93A-Veh mice) and 115 days (advanced stages of the disease) to analyze the motor function. The footprint test indicates muscle strength by measuring the stride length of mice (Filali et al., 2011; Mancuso et al., 2011). The average length of three strides measured from the center of each footprint was recorded as the stride length. The animals that were unable to right themselves within 20 s after being placed on either side or on the back were considered at the end stage and were sacrificed for humane reasons. The behavioral tests, data collection, and analysis were carried out by an investigator who was blinded to the experimental scheme.",

        "text": "Behavioural experiments. The effects of the CTEP treatment on disease symptoms were analysed in behavioural tests, three times per week starting at Day 80 of life (10 days before starting the treatment), until killing. Sample sizes and animal numbers were predetermined according to the guidelines for the preclinical in vivo evaluation of pharmacological treatments for ALS/MND (Ludolph et al., 2007). We dedicated four newborn litters for behavioural tasks. The experiments were littermate controlled; the mouse was the experimental unit. The pharmacological treatments were randomized within the cage. The same procedure was applied to histology, pharmacokinetics and release experiments. We start a first trial with 15 male + 15 female CTEP-treated (2 mg kg 1 every 48 h) and 15 male + 14 female vehicle-treated mice. Three female vehicle-treated mice were not included in the trial (accidental death before Day 100 of life); thus, we concluded the first trial with n = 30 SOD1G93A mice (15 males and 15 females) treated with CTEP at the dose of 2 mg kg 1 every 48 h and with n = 26 SOD1G93A mice (15 males and 11 females) treated with vehicle. We started the second trial with n = 26 SOD1G93A mice (14 males and 12 females) treated with CTEP at the dose of 4 mg kg 1 every 24 h and with n = 25 vehicle-treated SOD1G93A mice (14 males and 11 females). No deaths occurred in this trial; thus, we concluded this second trial with the starting number of animals. The behavioural studies were performed in a randomized order by blinded operators.",

        "text": "CPT1A antagonist studies A pilot study was conducted using female SOD1 (n\u2009=\u200910) and wildtype (n\u2009=\u20094) littermates. SOD1 mice were randomized into treatment with the irreversible CPT1A antagonist, etomoxir (5\u2009mg/kg) (n\u2009=\u20097), or placebo (olive oil) (n\u2009=\u20093) from day 100. Treatment was administered one a daily basis by oral gavage. Mice were evaluated weekly by neurological score, weight, and hangwire test as described under clinical behavior test. Following the pilot study, a larger study was setup. Female SOD1 (n\u2009=\u200918) and wildtype (n\u2009=\u20099) littermates were randomized into treatment with etomoxir or placebo from day 70. Mice were evaluated weekly by neurological score, grip strength, hangwire test, rotarod test, and at day 70, day 100 and day 130 mice were evaluated by cylinder, and y-maze test. Moreover, fecal samples were collected at day 70 before treatment start (n\u2009=\u20095), and at day 130 for the two SOD1 treatment groups. Serum, brain, muscle, and spinal cord tissue was obtained when mice were euthanized between day 145\u2013150. Another CPT1A antagonist study was conducted from day 70 and until day 130 to obtain spinal cord tissue for immunohistochemistry. Female SOD1 (n\u2009=\u200911) and wildtype littermates (n\u2009=\u20094) were randomized into treatment with etomoxir or placebo and evaluated by neurological score and grip strength once a week, as described below. At day 130 mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and quickly perfused with 1xPBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and spinal cords were harvested for further analyzes.",

Cerebral cortical cultures were generated as previously described [80] with some modifications. Briefly, cortices from individual brains of C9BAC mice were placed into ice-cold PBS 0.01 M (Gibco, Cat. No. 14185\u2013052) containing 50 \u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Cat. No. 15070\u2013063) and dissected into small pieces. Cortical tissue (one cortex for one 24-well plate) was digested in 2 ml PBS 0.01 M containing 50U of papain (Worthington, Cat. No. LS03126), 17 \u03bcg/\u03bcl L-Cysteine (Sigma, Cat. No. C7755) and 25 \u03bcl/ml DNAase (Roche, Cat. No. 1010415900) at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. Cells were transferred to a 15 ml tube containing Neurobasal Medium (Gibco 21103-049), 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin (Gibco, Cat. No. 15070-063) and 2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (5 mM; Sigma, Cat. No. A5284), re-suspended by mechanical agitation through fire-polished glass Pasteur pipettes of different tip diameters, and counted: 250,000 cells/well were plated on poly-L-lysine-coated 24-well plates (1 mg/ml; 30,000\u201370,000 MW; Sigma, Cat.

Each well contained Neurobasal Medium (Gibco, 21103-049) supplemented with B27 (Gibco, 17504-044) and 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009GlutaMax (Gibco, 3505006) in the presence of 100 \u03bcg/ml Primocin (InvivoGen, Cat. No. ANT-PM-1). One day after plating, cells were treated during 24 h for once with 20 \u03bcM cytosine arabinoside in order to prevent microglial proliferation. After that, all media was changed. Half of the media was replaced every 2\u20133 days. Treatments with PFI-1 (5 \u03bcM) were performed at 9 DIV for 24 h.",

        "text": "2.2. Experimental mouse model and treatments Transgenic mice carrying mutant human SOD1 with a substitution of glycine to alanine in position 93 (G93A), which show behavioral abnormalities and pathophysiological changes similar to those of ALS patients, have been widely used in ALS research. We purchased the hSOD1G93A mice (B6SJL-Tg-SOD1G93A-1Gur/J) from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The genotypes of hSOD1G93A mice were identified using PCR of tail DNA extracts according to our previous protocol [27]. All experiments and animals care procedures were strictly approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of the Harbin Medical University in China and performed in accordance with the International  Animal Care Guidelines. All mice were kept in a standard light/dark cycle (12/12 h) at room temperature with constant humidity (56 %), and the diet and water were provided ad libitum. DPDS was dissolved in canola oil before administration. In the first section, the hSOD1G93A mice (60 d) were randomly divided into two groups with similar numbers of males and females: (a) hSOD1G93A+ vehicle group (n = 40), treated with canola oil by intraperitoneal injection (10 mL/kg body weight, once daily); and (b) hSOD1G93A+DPDS group (n = 40), treated with DPDS by intraperitoneal injection (50 \u03bcmol/kg body weight, once daily). Age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates were also given the same treatment as control. The dose of DPDS employed in this study was based on a previous study [28]. Sixteen of the hSOD1G93A mice received the treatment intraperitoneally (i.p.) once a day starting from 60 days of age to the day of their death. The WT mice were treated with vehicle or DPDS from 60 to 180 days of age. The body weight of the mice was recorded every 4 days. The rest of hSOD1G93A mice were also treated from 60 days of age and sacrificed at different stages of disease: presymptomatic stage (pre-symp, 75 days), disease onset (95 days), symptomatic (symp, 120 days), late-symptomatic (late-symp, 130 days), and end-stage (ES), for fresh spinal cords or perfusing with paraformaldehyde (PFA) for the histological analysis of spinal cords.In addition, considering therapies are usually applied after patients show symptoms in clinical, some hSOD1G93A mice were administrated with DPDS after disease onset. The hSOD1G93A mice (100 d) were also randomly divided into two groups: (a) hSOD1G93A+ vehicle group (n =25), treated with canola oil by intraperitoneal injection (10 mL/kg body weight, once daily); and (b) hSOD1G93A+DPDS group (n = 25), treated with DPDS by intraperitoneal injection (50 \u03bcmol/kg body weight, once daily). Mice were administered starting 100 days of age and given until the end-stage of the disease.",

        "text": "RapidFire Mass spectrometry (MS) assay for the detection of histone deacetylase activity A high-throughput mass spectrometry assay with the RapidFireTM platform (Agilent Technology, Wakefield, MA) was used for detection of deacetylation activity with the acetylated peptide substrates derived from histone Bio-H4K12Ac (Anaspec #64849) and non-histone Bio-p53K382Ac (Anaspec #65046) sequences (Anaspec, Fremont, CA). Recombinant HDAC1 and HDAC2 enzyme preps were from BPS Biosciences (San Diego, CA). For the determination of dose-dependence curves, test compounds were preincubated with HDAC1 for 15 minutes in an assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, and 0.01% Brij-35. Deacetylation reactions were initiated following the addition of the acetylated peptide substrate. Histone deacetylase assay was performed in standard 384 well plates in a 50 \uf06dl reaction, and the reactions were terminated by adding 5 \uf06dl of 10% formic acid. For the mechanism of action experiments, deacetylation reactions were performed by varying the concentrations of both the substrate and the test compound. The EC50 values of individual compounds were estimated by performing deacetylation reactions with 40 nM enzyme and 1 \uf06dM of the acetylated peptide substrate. To keep the substrate conversion values under 10%, the enzymatic reaction durations for Bio-p53K382Ac and Bio-H4K12Ac were 45 and 60 minutes, respectively.For the MassSpec based detection, assay plates were transferred to a RapidFire200 integrated autosampler/solid-phase extraction (SPE) system (Agilent Technologies, Wakefield, MA) coupled with an API4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Concord, Ontario, Canada). Additional details for the RapidFire Mass Spec analysis are reported elsewhere. The percentage of substrate conversion was calculated as a function of product and substrate mass spectrum peak area. [%Substrate Conversion= 100*[Product/(Product+Substrate)]. Percentage of enzyme activation =100* [(MIN-test compound)/(MIN-MAX)], where MINimal (0%) enzyme activity was detected in the presence of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (10 \uf06dM SAHA) and MAXimal enzyme activity of HDAC1 reaction in the absence of test compound as 100% activity. MAX and MIN values were estimated as an average of 16 wells of a single column of 384-well plate. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 8. EC1.5 was estimated as the concentration of the activator molecule required to achieve 1.5-fold activation22. The data on the activation of histone deacetylase by small molecules were analyzed using non-essential enzyme activation.",

Nine images at 20X magnification were collected and analyzed from each well from a 96-well plate on an automated confocal microscope, IN Cell Analyzer 6000 (GE Healthcare). Immunofluorescent intensities of H3K9Ac mark in the nuclei (total ~ 2500 \u2013 4500 nuclei/treatment) were quantified by high-content image analysis (IN Cell Analyzer Workstation 3.7.2, GE Healthcare). H3K9 acetylation levels were reported after the intensities of the acetyl mark were normalized to DMSO-treated samples. Unpaired t-tests were used to determine treatment significance for all compounds tested.

MDCK cells (ICRF, UK) were maintained in DMEM (Gibco, Life Technologies, Grovemont, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco) in a humidified incubator at 37  C with 5% CO2. Small and compact colonies appear overnight after seeding 1000 cells per well in a 96-well plate. The medium was replaced with DMEM + 10% FCS supplemented with the ligands at di erent concentrations ranging from 10  M down to 0.1 pM using serial half-log dilutions. The next day, colony dispersal was observed at low magnification under an inverted microscope and the endpoint of observable scattering was determined for each protein. Using low magnification, three photos were taken of individual colonies at each concentration for all ligands",

Briefly, astrocytes were obtained dissecting cortices of E13-E14 embryos from SOD1G93A mice or their non-transgenic littermates and mechanically dissociation in Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 33 mM glucose. After centrifugation, the pellet was suspended in culture medium (Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/F12, 2 mM L-glutamine, 33 mM glucose, 5 \u00b5g/mL gentamycin, 10% horse serum) and seeded (500,000 cells/mL) onto 48- or 6-well plates coated with 1.5 \u00b5g/mL poly-L-ornithine. Repeated washing with HBSS, 12 h of orbital shaking at 200 rpm and treatment with 10 M AraC once they reached confluence, rendered astrocyte cultures free of microglia, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Spinal cords of E13-E14 embryos were dissected and mechanically dissociated in HBSS, 33 mM glucose. The cells were centrifuged onto a 4% bovine serum albumin cushion at 201 rcf for 10 min and the pellet resuspended in neuron culture medium: Neurobasal (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine, 33 mM glucose, 5 \u00b5g/mL gentamycin, 1 ng/mL brain-derived neurotrophic factor, 25 \u00b5g/mL insulin, 10 \u00b5g/mL putrescine, 30 nM sodium selenite, 2 \u00b5M progesterone, 100 \u00b5g/mL apo-transferrin, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 10 \u00b5M AraC. Cells were seeded (1,000,000 cells/mL) onto 48- or 6-well plates coated with 15 \u00b5g/mL poly-L-ornithine and 2 \u00b5g/mL laminin or onto a pre-established astrocyte confluent layer to obtain spinal neuron-cortical astrocyte co-cultures. Non-transgenic and SOD1G93A co-culture were obtained from non-transgenic and SOD1G93A neurons seeded on non-transgenic and SOD1G93A astrocytes, respectively. Motor neurons obtained from E13\u201314 embryos are fully differentiated and express the specific transcription factors Hb9 and Islet-1/2. A few days after plating, they show adult characteristics such as profuse dendrite and axon outgrowth and synapse formation [21,22]. Co-cultures were treated with HGF/SF, NK1 and K1K1. The molecules were administered at different doses every other day starting from the plating of the neurons, days in vitro (DIV) 0, 2 and 4. Co-cultures were fixed and analyzed at 6 DIV.",

        "text": "Metabolic flux analyses using Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer Mitochondrial OCR and ECAR were measured using a XFe96 Seahorse Biosciences Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent Technologies). Purified MNs or NPCs were plated onto a Matrigel pre-coated Seahorse 96-well plate at 125,000 neurons per well 24 h prior to the assay. Culture media were changed with 175 \u03bcl of fresh Seahorse DMEM basal medium 45 min prior to the assay. Seahorse analyzer injection ports were filled with 1 \u03bcM oligomycin, 1 \u03bcM carbonyl cyanide-4 (trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), or 0.5 \u03bcM each of rotenone and antimycin A for OCR. Briefly, oligomycin was first added to the cells to inhibit ATP synthase, which affects the electron flow through the ETC, and a decreased in OCR is linked to cellular ATP production. Then, FCCP, an uncoupling agent, is added to the cells where it collapses the proton gradient and disrupting mitochondrial membrane potential. The electron flow through the ETC becomes uninhibited, and OCR will reach its maximum. The FCCP-stimulated OCR can be used to calculate spare respiratory capacity (difference between maximal OCR and basal OCR), a measurement on the ability for the cell to respond to increased energy demand or under stress. The last modulator added to the cell is a mixture of rotenone and antimycin A, which are Complexes I and II inhibitors, respectively. The mixture shuts down mitochondrial respiration completely, and non-mitochondrial respiration can be calculated. Biological triplicates were performed with a minimum of ten technical replicates each. ECAR measures the extracellular acid produced by cells, where lactic acid and pyruvic acid are produced by glycolysis and carbon dioxide is produced during the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Briefly, basal acidification, contributed by pyruvic acid, lactic acid, and carbonic acid, is measured at the start of the assay. Upon addition of 10mM glucose, glycolysis is initiated and the resultant increase in acidification is contributed by pyruvic acid and lactic acid. Next, oligomycin treatment at 1 \u03bcM blocks ATP production from mitochondrial respiration and allows the glycolytic capacity of the MNs to be established. Lastly, 50mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) acts as a glycolysis inhibitor, and its addition allows for the measurement of non-glycolytic acidification. Glycolytic capacity was calculated as the difference between ECAR following the injection of 1 \u03bcm oligomycin, and the basal ECAR reading. Glycolytic reserve was calculated as the difference in ECAR between glucose and oligomycin injections. Biological triplicates were performed with a minimum of ten technical replicates each",

The scores from \u201c0\u201d to \u201c5\u201d are defined as follows: \u201c0\u201d indicates a healthy mouse with no classical signs of ALS; \u201c1\u201d indicates the presence of tremors in the hind legs that occur in early disease stage; \u201c2\u201d indicates that mice have difficulty in separating their hind legs when suspended by their tails, which is indicative of muscle weakness; \u201c3\u201d is given when mice exhibit difficulty walking, either stumbling or wobbling; \u201c4\u201d is given when mice were unable to walk on all four legs and drag their hind legs; \u201c5\u201d is given when mice were unable to right themselves after 30 s. When the animals reach a score of \u201c4,\u201d the access to food and water is facilitated by placing food pellets on the cage floor to all transgenic mice. Reaching a score of \u201c5,\u201d the animals are euthanized for ethical reasons. Onset is defined as the earliest time when the mice show symptoms (score < 4). Changes over time in the different groups were monitored weekly.",

Changes over time in evoked compound motor action potential (CMAP) in the gastrocnemius muscle after stimulation of the sciatic nerve were monitored at two time points along the experiment. Recordings were made on a 2-channel electromyography system (Keypoint portable; Medtronic, Skovlunde, Denmark), with the high-frequency filter set at 5 kHz and the low-frequency filter set at 2 Hz. Electric stimulation produces artifacts; to reduce them, rectangular monophase electric pulses with a pulse width of 0.04 ms were used. For CMAP measurements, the stimulation electrode was placed on the nerve at a distance of 1 cm from the recording electrode placed on the gastrocnemius muscle through percutaneous puncture in the distal third of the paw, ipsilaterally to the surgical procedure, with a coaxial needle. The data of CMAP amplitude (A) were expressed in millivolts, the data of latency (B) were expressed in milliseconds, and the data of nerve conduction velocity (C) were expressed in meters per second (m/s).

Whole-blood samples (0.5 mL) were collected in sodium citrate tubes at 4 \u00b0C. Then a whole-blood aliquot of 0.1 mL was transferred to a cryovial containing 0.9 mL of 0.5 M ice-cold perchloric acid to lyse all blood cells. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000g \u00d7 10 min (4 \u00b0C). Supernatants were stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until analyzed. NAD+ levels in the CNS were measured fluorimetrically using a kit from Promega (Madison, WI) and following manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and also by HPLC as above.

        "text": "Measurement of Cytokines. In mice, samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained following the methodology described in detail by Lim et al. [26]. Briefly, to collect the CSF, mice were first anesthetized with buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg). Then, the hair at the back of the head of the mouse from above the eyes, between the ears to the bottom of the neck, was removed using clippers and depilatory cream. The head of the mouse was secured using an adapter. Using a dissecting microscope, scissors, and curved forceps, and by cutting through the skin and the layers of muscle, the base of the skull over the cisterna magna was exposed. The use of a micromanipulator and glass capillary\u2013 attached setup system allowed obtaining a total amount of ~ 10\u201315 \u03bcL of CSF in 10\u201330 min. The technique may cause, although infrequently, some very minor bleeding which can be controlled using cotton buds and Cutoline Alum Hemostatic sticks; the area was cleaned for insertion of the glass capillary with distilled H2O to avoid contamination of the sample. Microscopic analysis was routinely performed to detect blood contamination, and only samples with no blood contamination were used. The CSF samples were stored for further analysis at \u221280 \u00b0C. This whole procedure was performed in conditions of asepsis to avoid any bacterial contamination. In humans, samples of CSF were obtained by standard lumbar puncture. This study was approved by the University of Valencia Institutional Review Board on Human Studies (ref. H1479983999044), and participants provided written informed consent. All the procedures followed the Declaration of Helsinki. Eligible participants were 45 years of age or older and diagnosed with SALS by El Escorial criteria, with an onset of symptomatology for more than 12 months. The study recruited both female and male participants; females were not lactating, had a negative pregnancy test, and agreed to use an effective method of birth control throughout the duration of the study. All patients received riluzole treatment according to standard dosage. The exclusion criteria were identical to those used in a previous study [21]. The simultaneous quantification of different cytokines in the CSF was performed using xMAP technology and a MAGPIX Luminex 200 platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, after the incubation of a specific monoclonal antibody conjugated bead population with 50 \u03bcL of CSF samples for 1 h (room temperature), washed beads (color-coded beads of specific monoclonal antibodies) were incubated with detection antibody solution for 30 min, then with the streptavidin\u2013phycoerythrin-conjugated solution (10 min). After washing, the beads were resuspended in the assay buffer, shaken for 1 min, and then read on the MAGPIX instrument. The results were analyzed with xPONENT 4.2\u00ae software and expressed as picograms per milliliter.",

GCL, GSR, GST, GGT, SOD1, and SOD2 activities were measured as previously described in detail [31]. HMOX2 activity was measured as described by [32]. Protein concentration was determined with the Pierce BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The assay of H2O2 production was based on the H2O2- dependent oxidation of homovanillic acid (4-hydroxy-3- methoxyphenylacetic acid) to a highly fluorescent dimer (2,2\u2032-dihydroxydiphenyl-5,5\u2032-diacetic acid), which is mediated by horseradish peroxidase [31]. For this purpose, cells were cultured in the presence of 100 \u03bcM homovanillic acid and 1 unit/mL horseradish peroxidase. A linear relationship between fluorescence (\u03bbex = 312 nm and \u03bbem = 420 nm) and amount of H2O2 was found in the range of 0.1\u201312 nmol/ 2-mL assay. Generation of O2\u00b7\u2212 was quantitated using an electrochemical biosensor as previously described [33]. Briefly, a Co3(PO4)2 nanorod/glassy carbon electrode was applied to in situ electrochemically detect O2\u00b7\u2212 released from MNs (5 \u00d7 105/mL) in real time. In order to ensure accuracy of measured O2\u00b7\u2212 concentrations, the cell culture medium inside the device was mildly stirred during cell released O2\u00b7\u2212 measurement. The electrochemical measurements were carried out on a CHI760 electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments Inc., Austin, TX). Glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) were determined by LC/MS as previously reported [30]. Cell processing was performed according to published methodology, where rapid N-ethylmaleimide derivatization was used to prevent GSH auto-oxidation [34]. NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH in cultured MNs were quantitated using assay kits from MyBiosource (San Diego, CA).",

To have positive controls, we used Abcam\u2019s anti-SIRT1 antibody (ab7343) and anti-SIRT3 antibody (ab189860). Every sample was also assayed after in vitro neutralization with anti-SIRT1 or anti-SIRT3 monoclonal antibodies. Through this methodology we found that 5\u20136% of the SIRT1 activity and 7\u20138% of the SIRT3 activity, measured in extracts of isolated MNs, were non-specific. Those small percentages were subtracted from the total activity. To ensure that the cell extract does not affect per se the determination of enzyme activities, in samples where the presence of SIRT1 or SIRT3 was previously removed by immunoprecipitation, we proceeded to determine the activity resulting from adding progressively increasing amounts of recombinant murine SIRT1 or SIRT3 (Abcam). As shown in Fig. S1, the reaction rate was linear in samples from MNs isolated from SOD1G93A mice treated with NR as in Table 1 (see under \u201cResults\u201d). None of the different pretreatments (Table 1) significantly affected the linear activity of the recombinant enzymes.",

To prepare a soluble cytosolic fraction, isolated MNs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the pellet was suspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (2 \u00d7 106 cells per mL of buffer:20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mg/mL each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A). The cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 2500g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C, the supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. The resulting supernatant was used as the soluble cytosolic fraction (SCF). Protein (50 \u03bcg) was boiled in Laemmli buffer and resolved by 12.0% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to western blotting with specific monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). The anti-SOD1 antibody (ALS mutant) was from Sigma-Aldrich. Blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system; Amersham Systems, GE HealthCare Life Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden). To detect PAR polymers, we used an anti-PAR monoclonal antibody from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The LentiBrite\u2122 LC3-II Enrichment Kit from Merck uses a selective permeabilization procedure that removes cytosolic LC3-I and retains autophagosome-bound LC3-II. We used this procedure which specifically reveals quantities of LC3- II, without interference from LC3-I. Protein bands were quantified using laser densitometry. Equal protein loading on membranes and complete transfer were confirmed by staining the gels and membranes with Coomassie Blue. To make the pooling of data from different immunoblots possible, the relative density of each band was normalized against the internal standard analyzed on each blot.",

These animals carry a transgene containing 6 NF-\u03baB-responsive elements (RE) from the CMV\u03b1 (immediate early) promoter placed upstream of a basal SV40 promoter, and a modified firefly luciferase cDNA (Promega pGL3). The reporter is inducible by LPS and TNF\u03b1 intraperitoneal injection [30]. Animals were randomized divided into four groups and intraperitoneally injected with increasing doses of BANA (10, 20, and 30 mg/kg), benzoic acid (30 mg/kg), dimethyl fumarate (30 mg/kg), or vehicle (DMSO 10% (v/v)/ PEG 20% (v/v) in phosphate buffer). After 2 h, animals wereintraperitoneally injected with LPS (1 mg/kg). Differences in luciferase activity were compared between groups after 3 h following LPS injection. To accomplish that, 150 mg/kg of the substrate D-luciferin (#K9918PE, XenoLight) dissolved in PBS, pH 7.4 was injected intraperitoneally to each mouse. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3.0% induction, 2.5% maintenance), placed in a ventral position in the lighttight imaging chamber, and imaged 10 min after luciferin injection using bioluminescence and X-ray modes (5 s acquisition, performed in Preclinical In-Vivo Xtreme II Optical/Xray imaging system, Bruker, USA).

        "text": "Study of Nuclear Translocation of NF-\u03baB in HT-29 Reporter Cell Line The effect of BANA on nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB was studied by using the HT-29 NF-\u03baB reporter cell line as previously described [31]. Briefly, cells were treated with increasing doses of BANA (10, 20, and 30 \u03bcM), benzoic acid (30 \u03bcM), dimethyl fumarate (30 \u03bcM), or vehicle (DMSO) for 3 h. After treatment, cells were stimulated and coincubated with TNF\u03b1 (1 ng/ml) for 24 h. Finally, cells were trypsinized and resuspended for flow cytometry analysis. Cells were analyzed using an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with 488 and 405 nm lasers. Attune NxT Software was used for data acquisition and FlowJo v.10 for data analysis. Green Fluorescent Protein and propidium iodide fluorescence emissions were detected using band-pass filters 530/30 and 695/40, respectively. For each sample, 10,000 counts gated on a forward scatter versus side scatter dot plot, excluding doublets, were recorded. Only single living cells (cells that excluded propidium iodide) were considered for results comparison.",

After harvesting the cells, mRNA extraction using the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN) was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. mRNA yields were measured on Nanodrop device (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cDNA was obtained from 0.5 \u03bcg of RNA, 4 \u03bcL of iScript reverse transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (Bio-Rad, \u2212 20 \u00b0C) in a final volume of 20 \u03bcL filled with nuclease-free water. The Thermocycler was set as follows: priming 5 min at 25 \u00b0C followed by 30 min at 42 \u00b0C for reverse transcription and 5\u2032 at 85 \u00b0C for RT inactivation. RT-qPCR was performed on reverse-transcribed cDNA using SsoAdvanced\u2122 Universal SYBR\u00ae Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) on a CFX96 Touch\u2122 real-time PCR detection system. For each well, 5 \u03bcL of diluted DNA was added to 20 \u03bcL of the mix (containing 1 \u03bcL of each primer, 12.5 \u03bcL of SsoAdvanced\u2122 Universal SYBR\u00ae Green Supermix, 5.5 \u03bcL of nuclease-free water). Each sample was run in duplicate. The cycling parameters were as follows: 30 s at 95 \u00b0C then 40 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 10 and 30 s at 60 \u00b0C. Cq values were obtained for every cycle. Primers were designed on NCBI Primer-BLAST following the best guidelines to exclude genomic DNA amplification. The analysis was done using Bio-Rad CFX manager 3.1 with a threshold set at 650 RFU corresponding to the amplification curves linear portion. Variations between samples were normalized using two housekeeping genes \u03b2-Actin and HPRT. All primers were validated for specificity and efficiency.

MTT tetrazolium salt was dissolved in serum-free culture medium. The cells were seeded into 96-well plates (50,000 cells per well) and cultured overnight. After incubation under various experimental conditions (for the experimental design see Supplemental Materials and Methods File S1), the cells were incubated in the presence of MTT tetrazolium salt (0.15 mg/mL) for 3 h at 37  C. Finally, the medium was removed, and dark violet formazan dissolved in a solution of isopropanol and HCl (0.22 N). The absorbance was measured at 580 nm with a Thermo Labsystem plate reader. Results were expressed as percentage of control values.",

A U2OS (human osteosarcoma) cell line stably overexpressing turbo\u2010GFP\u2010tagged human TDP\u201043 was used to screen the effects of ACP (0.01 nM to 50 \u00b5M) and BCL (2 nM to 50 \u00b5M), alone or mixed in 36 PXT864 combinations, on TDP\u201043 stress granule formation induced by sodium arsenate (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, cat#35000 Fluka) at 250 \u00b5M for 90 min. Briefly, recombinant TDP\u201043\u2010tGFP\u2010U2OS cell line was thawed (2x106 cells per T75) and were maintained in DMEM\u2010F12 supplemented with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for 5 days. Cells were then plated in Poly\u2010l\u2010Lysine coated 96\u2010well plates (10,000 cells per well) and maintained in DMEM\u2010F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 5 mM IPTG for 24 hr at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere to induce TDP\u201043\u2010tGFP expression. Drugs were applied to cultures 24 hr before arsenate addition. Pathological TDP\u201043 stress granule formation was assessed prior to formaldehyde fixation (3.7%). Nuclei were stained using 2 \u00b5g/ml DAPI and fluorescence was measured using a BD Pathway 855 High\u2010Content Bioimager (Becton Dickinson). Numbers of TDP\u201043\u2010GFP granules per cell were quantified using Attovision software (Becton Dickinson).",

The human muscle cell line was purchased from Promocell (cat#C\u201012530) and was plated (21 000 cells per well) in gelatin\u2010coated 1% (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, Cat#G9382) in water on 48\u2010well plate and grown in a proliferation medium consisting of mix of 62% of MEM medium (Minimum Essential Media, Pan Biotech, Cat#P04\u201008500) and 25% of M199 medium (Pan Biotech, Cat#P04\u201007500) supplemented with glutamine 2 mM (Pan Biotech, Cat#P04\u201080100), human insulin 10 \u00b5g/ml (Pan Biotech, Cat#P07\u201004100), human recombinant epidermal growth factor 10 ng/ml (EGF, Gibco, Cat#PHG0311), human recombinant Fibroblast growth factor basic 2 ng/ml (bFGF, Pan Biotech, Cat#CB\u20101102024), fetal calf serum 10% (FCS, Gibco, Cat#10270106), and 2% of penicillin 10,000 U/ml and streptomycin 10 g/ml (PS, Pan Biotech, Cat#P06\u201007100). The medium was changed every 2 days. Five days after the start of culture, immediately after satellite cell fusion, whole transverse slices of 13\u2010day\u2010old rat Wistar embryos' spinal cords with four dorsal root ganglia (DRG) attached were placed on the muscle monolayer (one explant per well in the central area). DRG were necessary to achieve a good ratio of innervation. Innervated cultures were maintained in a mixed (67% MEM/25% medium 199) medium composed of MEM and medium 199, supplemented with 5% FCS, insulin 5 \u00b5g/ml, 1% glutamine 2 mM, and 2% PS. After 24 hr of coculture, neurites were observed growing out of the spinal cord explants. These neurites made contacts with myotubes and induced the first contractions after ~8 days.  On day 27 after the beginning of the culture, contracting cocultures were preincubated for 1 hr with either ACP (0.14 nM to 40 nM), BCL (32 nM to 2000 nM), or PXT864 (25 combinations) before glutamate intoxication (60 \u03bcM for 20 min), and for a further 48 hr (Figure 1a). To check the contractile functionality of the NMJs and to avoid any confusion with spontaneous contractions, the cocultures were treated with acetyl choline (100 nM). Only cocultures that immediately after application, showed contractions were retained for the study and distributed into the treatment groups. The effects of riluzole on the same endpoints below were investigated. On day 23, cultures were preincubated for 96 hr with or without riluzole (5 \u00b5M) followed by incubation with PXT864 (0.14 nM ACP and 32 nM BCL), riluzole, or both 1 hr prior to glutamate intoxication and for a further 48 hr (Figure 2a).",

Briefly, embryos (E14) were collected and immediately placed in ice\u2010cold L15 Leibovitz medium (Dutscher, cat#P04\u201027005) with a 2% penicillin (10,000 U/ml) and streptomycin (10 mg/ml) solution (PS, Dutscher, cat#P06\u201007100) and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Dutscher, cat#P06\u20101391100).  Each embryo was dispatched on numerating petri dish (35 mm of diameter). Tail of embryos was cut for genotyping (see 2.2 Animals section). Spinal cords were removed and pooled by genotype in ice\u2010cold medium of Leibovitz (L15) and treated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C with a trypsin\u2013EDTA solution (Dutscher, cat#P10\u2010023100) at a final concentration of 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. The dissociation was stopped by the addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/L of glucose (Dutscher, cat#P04\u201003600), containing DNase I grade II (final concentration 0.5 mg/ml) (Dutscher, cat#P60\u201037780100) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Dutscher, cat#S15898S181B). Cells were mechanically dissociated by three forced passages through the tip of a 10\u2010ml pipette. Cells were then centrifuged at 180 x g for 10 min at +4\u00b0C on a layer of BSA (3.5%) in L15 medium. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in a defined culture medium consisting of Neurobasal medium (Fisher scientific, cat#1894793) with a 2% solution of B27 supplement (Fisher scientific, cat#1899722), 2 mM of l\u2010glutamine (Dutscher, cat#3220316), 2% of PS solution (Fisher scientific, cat#4650416), and 10 ng/ml of brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, Dutscher, cat#H151208). Viable cells were counted in a Neubauer cytometer, using the trypan blue exclusion test and were seeded at a density of 20 000 cells per well in 96\u2010well plates precoated with poly\u2010l\u2010lysine and were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified air (95%)/CO2 (5%) atmosphere. Half of the medium was changed every other day.  Motoneurons were treated from days 1 to 9 with PXT864 (0.05 to 0.32 nM ACP and 12 to 80 nM BCL) alone or with riluzole (1 \u00b5M) to assess survival and maturity of SOD1G93A motoneurons. To assess protective activity against glutamate intoxication, cells were exposed to PXT864 alone or with riluzole (1 \u00b5M) on day 13 for 1 hr before glutamate intoxication (5 \u00b5M for 20 min) and for a further 24 hr.",

Immunoblotting analysis Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and total protein extracts were obtained by lysing them as previously described (Alquezar et al., 2016). Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were obtained using the Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit, (Cat#: 78840, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madrid, Spain) following the manufacturer's instructions. Lamin B1 and \u03b1-Tubulin were used as markers for nuclear and cytosolic fractions, respectively. The protein content of the extracts was determined by the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Cat#: 23225, Thermo Fisher, Madrid Spain). Equal amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes and immunodetected, as previously described (Alquezar et al., 2014). The following primary antibodies were used: TDP-43 (1:1,000); phospho-(S409/410)- TDP-43 (1:500); \u03b2-actin (1:500); \u03b1-tubulin (1:1,000) and Lamin B1 (1:1,000), pRb (1:500), CDK6 (1:1,000), and CDC-7 (1:500). Signals from the primary antibodies were amplified using speciesspecific antisera conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Cat#: 1662408EDU, Bio-Rad, Alcobendas, Madrid, Spain) and detected with a chemiluminescent substrate detection system ECL (Cat#: W1001, Promega Biotech Ib\u00e9rica, SL, Alcobendas, Madrid, Spain).

Following sacrifice, brains were removed and placed in a steel brain matrix (1 mm Coronal, Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA). Left and right hemispheres were separated by a midline sagittal incision. Serial coronal brain slices (1 mm thick) were prepared, beginning at slice number three, 2 mm anterior to the bregma. Each brain yielded 18 coronal slices (nine from each respective hemisphere). Each slice was placed into a single well in 96-well black microplates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) containing substrate bu er (in mM: 150 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 50 Tris-HCl: pH 8.0), 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), bestatin 0.1 mg/mL and prolylendopeptidase inhibitor (0.2 mM). Substrate (14  M) was added to the microplate immediately prior to initiating the fluorescence signal reading. Measurements were carried out using a microplate reader (Infinite 2000; Tecan, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland) with excitation and emission filters of 360   35 and 460   35 nm, respectively.

        "text": "Pharmacokinetic Analysis 2-month old SOD1 mice were split into 4 different groups and given either 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg doses of MBi-9 chow (n = 3/group) and WT mice were given 30 mg/kg of MBi-9 chow (n = 3). Mice were singly housed and treated for 10 days. The amount of food eaten per day and the daily body weight was measured throughout the dosing period. Plasma and brain concentrations were determined as previously described [34, 35]. After 10 days of treatment, mice were deeply anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and their blood was collected via cardia puncture into heparin-coated tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The blood was spun down at 3000 rpm for 15 min and the plasma was collected and frozen on dry ice before being stored long term at \u2212 80 \u00b0C. The mice were then perfused with ice-cold 1X PBS before dissecting out the whole brains which were then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C. The actual dose calculated from the amount of chow being eaten was done by multiplying the dose in the chow by the amount of drug eaten then dividing by the body weight of the mouse (diet dose*drug eaten/body weight). The amount of drug measured in the plasma and brain samples was determined by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using non-validated assays.",

        "text": "Transgenic mice and treatment Transgenic SOD1G93A mice expressing mutant human SOD1 with a Gly93Ala substitution (B6SJL-Tg-SOD1G93A-1Gur) were originally obtained from Jackson Laboratories (No. 002726). The genotypes of the transgenic mice were identified by PCR as in our previous reports [8]. Verapamil (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in ddH2O to a final concentration of 0.125mg/\u03bcL and further diluted with ddH2O before intraperitoneal injection. As there is gender differences in terms of disease progression and lifespan in SOD1G93A mice [24], we used only male mice to avoid gender diversity. To assess the effect of verapamil on disease onset and survival, 24 male SOD1G93A mice were randomly divided into 2 groups: (1) Tg-Vera group, intraperitoneally injected with verapamil at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight/day (n = 12); (2) Tg-Con group, used as control, intraperitoneally injected with the same volume of ddH2O (n = 12). The injection was given once a day starting from 64 days after birth until the day of death. No significant side effects under this dosage were observed in our experiment.  To explore the mechanisms of neuroprotective effects provided by verapamil, 24 SOD1G93A mice and 24 age- and sex-matched wild-type (WT) littermates were randomly divided into four groups: verapamil treatment at the dose of 25mg/kg body weight/day in SOD1G93A mice (Tg-Vera, n = 12) or WT mice (WT-Vera, n = 12), and ddH2O treatment in SOD1G93A mice (Tg-Con, n = 12) or WT mice (WT-Con, n = 12). These mice were sacrificed at the age of 120 days for Western blotting and skeletal muscle analysis, immunofluorescent staining, electron microscopy analysis and calpain activity assay.  All animals were housed at 21 ~ 24? and controlled 12-hour light/dark cycle. Animal use was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and all procedures in our experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of NIH for animal care.",

        "text": "Compound Screen E18 rat hippocampal neurons were routinely seeded at 30,000 cells/well on Greiner Cellstar 96 well plates, cat# 655090 (4238 Capital Drive, Monroe, NC 28110) coated with 20 \u03bcg/mL poly-L-Lysine (Sigma Aldrich) and 3.5 ug/mL laminin (ThermoFisher Scientific) overnight at room temperature, and maintained in Neurobasal medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with B27 (GIBCO), L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells in each well were transfected with 0.3 \u03bcg Mito-DSred at DIV6-7 using 0.8 \u03bcL Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher Sientific, Waltham, MA 02451) and imaged at DIV8-9. Small molecule libraries were obtained from ICCB-Longwood (https://iccb.med.harvard.edu/). Compounds were pin-transferred into Greiner 384 well plates (cat#784201) at the ICCB-Longwood facility and immediately added to the cells using Agilent Bravo Liquid Handling Platform (Agilent, 5301 Stevens Creek Blvd, Santa Clara, CA 95051). Cells were incubated with compounds at 3\u03bcM for 1 h before and during time-lapse imaging. The plates were dosed and imaged one at a time. Z-scores were calculated for each parameter using the formula Z = (x-\u03bc)/\u03c3. A cutoff of Z-score > 3 in KS integrated distance was used to identify hits. Dose-response curves were performed using either six to eight quarter-log concentration increments with maximum values reaching the concentration used in the screen (3 \u03bcM). Concentrations (in nM) were transformed to log nM and values were internally normalized from low to high as percentage activity. Curve fitting was performed in GraphPad Prism using log(agonist) versus normalized response \u2013 variable slope \u2013curve fitting. Values presented in Figure 2 were collected from an average of three to six well replicates from one 96-well plate.",

        "text": "Time-Lapse High-Content Imaging of Mitochondrial Transport Neurons were imaged on an ArrayScan XTI imaging platform (ThermoFisher Sientific, Waltham, MA 02451). 30 frames per field were acquired at the maximum speed of 2 Hz. Four fields were imaged per well of a 96-well plate containing 30,000 rat hippocampal neurons/well at DIV08-09 using a 20X objective with 2x2 binning. To minimize well to well differences in exposure to compounds, the fields were imaged according to this sequence: field 1 was imaged in every well before returning to the start of the plate and imaging field 2 in every well, and similarly for fields 3 and 4. Imaging one field per well for 96 wells took ~30 min when acquiring 30 frames at 2Hz in each well. As a result, collecting a series from each of the 4 fields took a total of 2 h per 96-well plate. This protocol was used for the primary screen, compound retesting, and dose response curves in Figure 2, as well as for all experiments in Figures 3, \u200b,4,4, and \u200band6A6A\u20136C. During imaging, neurons were maintained in conditioned media at 37C and 5%CO2. In the primary screen the plate was incubated with Tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester (TMRM, ThermoFisher Scientific, cat#T668), and with Hoechst dye upon completion of the time-lapse sequence and then live-imaged again to determine mitochondrial membrane potential.",

        "text": "Immunohistochemical Staining of Rats\u2019 Spinal Cords At least 4 rats were analyzed for each immunohistochemistry experiment. Three different conditions were studied as follows: 1) non-transgenic (NonTg) rats of 160\u2013180 days; 2) transgenic SOD1G93A rats of 195\u2013210 days treated with vehicle (paralysis, 15d-vehicle) and 3) transgenic SOD1G93A rats of 195\u2013210 days treated with 50 or 100 mg/kg/day of BANA during 15 days. After treatment animals were deeply anesthetized and transcardial perfusion was performed with paraformaldehyde 4% (v/v) in PBS pH = 7.4. Fixed spinal cords were removed, post-fixed by immersion overnight in paraformaldehyde 4% (v/v) in PBS pH = 7.4, and then transverse sectioned (30 \u03bcm) in a Leica cryostat. Serial sections were collected in PBS pH = 7.4 for immunohistochemistry. Free-floating sections were blocked and permeabilized for 1 h at room temperature with Triton X-100 0.5% (v/v)/BSA 5% (v/v) in PBS pH = 7.4, passed through washing buffered solutions, and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C in a solution of Triton X-100 0.5% (v/v)/BSA 1% (v/v) in PBS pH = 7.4 containing the followingprimary antibodies: 1:500 rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako, #019- 19741), 1:300 mouse anti-Iba1 (Millipore, #MABN92), 1:300 rabbit anti-ChAT (Millipore, #AB143), 1:300 mouse anti-CD68 (Abcam, #ab31630), 1:200 rabbit anti-CD34 (Abcam, #ab81289), 1:400 mouse anti-GFAP (Sigma, #G3893), 1:400 rabbit anti-GFAP (Sigma, #G9269), 1:400 mouse anti-S100\u03b2 (Sigma, #S2532), 1:200 rabbit anti- NF-\u03baB-p65 (Abcam, #ab16502), 1:200 rabbit anti-Ki67 (Abcam, #ab16667), 1:200 rabbit anti-ubiquitin (Millipore, #05-1307), 1:200 mouse anti-nitrotyrosine (Millipore, #05233), 1:300 anti-VGlut-1 (SySy, #135-303), 1:300 antisynaptophysin (Abcam, #206870), 1:200 anti-\u03b2III-Tubulin (Millipore, #MAB1637). Immunostaining with rabbit anti- NF-\u03baB-p65, mouse anti-Iba1, rabbit anti-Ki67, mouse anti- CD68, and rabbit anti-ubiquitin required free-floating citrate buffer (sodium citrate 10mM, pH 6) antigen retrieval at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min. NeuroTrace 530/615 red fluorescent Nissl stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #B34650) was also used for visualizing neurons. After incubation with primary antibodies, free-floating slices were washed with PBS 3 times for 10 min, incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the following secondary antibodies: 1:500 goat anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A21052), 1:500 goat anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 546 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A11035), 1:500 goat anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 633 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A21052), 1:500 Streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 405 or Alexa Fluor 633 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #S21375), washed with PBS 3 times for 5 min and mounted in DPX mounting medium (Sigma, #06522-100ML).",

For the symptomatic stage study (survival experiment), the treatment started to 95 days of age and stopped when mice were euthanized. Mice showing strong motor dysfunction at 93 days of age were not included in the symptomatic cohort. Mice were euthanized when animals were paralyzed and unable to roll over within 5 s after being pushed on their back.

        "text": "Co-Culture of Spinal Cord Explants and Myoblasts The rat spinal cord\u2013human muscle co-culture was performed as described previously (Combes et al., 2015). Human myoblast was grown on 96-well plate in a mix of MEM and M199 medium, supplemented with glutamine 2 mM, insulin, epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, fetal bovine serum 10%, and penicillin/streptomycin. Spinal cord explants with dorsal roots of 13-day-old Wistar rat embryos (Janvier, Le Genest-St-IsIe, France) were dissected and grown on the muscle monolayer. The co-cultures were maintained in a mix medium (MEM/M199), with 5% fetal calf serum, insulin, glutamine, and penicillin streptomycin. Ambroxol treatment was initiated when the spinal cord explants were added to the muscle monolayer and lasted 27 days. The treatment was renewed every other day during medium change. A total of 10 wells per conditions have been initiated. In vitro NMJs and Spinal Cord Explants and Myoblastsnetwork were identified by immunostaining with alpha-bungarotoxin coupled with Alexa 488 and with a primary antibody against neurofilament 200 kD from mouse revealed with an anti-mouse Alexa 568. Sixty pictures have been automatically taken using same acquisition parameter with ImageXpress (Molecular Device) at 10\u00d7 magnification and were analyzed with MetaXpress (Molecular Device). After segmentation of the pictures ( Supplementary Figure 3 ), the total length of the neurite network and the total area of clustered nAChR were measured.",

The assay plate was a 13\u2009\u00d7\u200910-cm plate filled with agar, which was divided into 8 regions of equal area. Regions were surrounded with glycerol, an aversive stimulus for C. elegans, to keep animals from moving over to the other regions. Filter paper (Whatman/3MM paper) was used to remove excess NG buffer. Worms from a given compound-treated group were placed in 1 of the 8 regions with various compounds being tested simultaneously.  An adapted version of the MWT10 was used to record the locomotion of C. elegans on the agar plate. Adaptations included a Toshiba-Teli Ultra High Resolution 12\u2009M pixel CMOS sensor camera-link camera (CSC12M25BMP19-01B), a lens (RICHO FL-YFL3528), and an adaptor (Toshiba-Teli FTAR-2).

        "text": "Mouse MN Differentiation and Survival Assays Mouse wild-type (Hb9-GFP) and mutant (SOD1G93A/Hb9-GFP) ES cell colonies were dissociated and cultured in 45% DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies), 45% Neurobasal (Life Technologies), 10% KnockOut Serum Replacement (Life Technologies) with 2mML-glutamine (Life Technologies), 55 mM b-mercaptoethanol (Life Technologies), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies). After 2 days, embryoid bodies were treated with retinoic acid (RA; 100 nM) and a hedgehog agonist (SAG;100 nM). On day 3, embryoid bodies were treated with RA (100 nM) and SAG (1 mM) and incubated for 72 h. Papain (Worthington  Biochemical) and DNase I (Worthington Biochemical) were used to dissociate embryoid bodies. Cells were plated on polyornithine- coated 96-well plates, 12-well plates or 6- well plates and cultured in DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies), 2% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies), 10 mg/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), progesterone, BSA, selenite and apotransferrin (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with B27 (Life Technologies), 20 ng/ml GDNF (R&D Systems), 20 ng/ml BDNF (R&D Systems) and 20 ng/ml CNTF (R&D Systems) (Makhortova et al., 2011). MNs were seeded at a density of 3 3 104 GFP+ cells per 100 mL medium(96-well plate). An antimitotic agent Ara-C was added into the culture medium from day 2 to eliminate progenitors. TFs were removed  4 days after plating, at which time, siRNAs or small molecules were added. After an additional 3 days, cells were scanned using a high-content live-imaging microscope (PerkinElmer Operetta) at 10x magnification. For each well of 96-well plate, 9-12 evenly distributed fields were imaged, covering more than 50% of the well. The number of surviving MNs was measured by counting GFP+ cells with healthy neurites using Columbus Image Analysis software (Perkin Elmer). For long-term studies, MNs were fed with fresh medium and re-treated with siRNA or chemicals every 3-4 days. The number of healthy MNs was quantified at different time points as needed.",

        "text": "Human MN differentiation and Survival Assays Human wild-type ESCs (H9/Islet-RFP), wild-type iPSCs (BJsiPSC) and iPSCs from ALS patients (SOD1L144F, TDP43G298S, and TDP43M337V) were differentiated as embryoid bodies in DMEM/F12 containing 1% N2 and 2% B27. The embryoid bodies were treated with 1 mM Dorsomorphin (Stemgent) and 10 mM SB431542 (Stemgent) for 4 days, with addition of 1 mM retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mM smoothened agonist (EMD Millipore) after 5 more days. After, embyroid body formation, colonies were then plated on poly-ornithine and laminin-coated plates to differentiate neural progenitors to MNs. After an additional 14-20 days of differentiation, the cultures were dissociated to single cells with Papain (Worthington Biochemical) and DNase I (Worthington Biochemical). MNs were seeded on astrocyte-coated plates at a density of 3-5 3 105 cells per ml in neurobasal containing 1% N2, 2% B27, 20% D-Glucose, 200 mg/ml Ascorbic acid with 20 ng/ml GDNF, 20 ng/ml BDNF and 20 ng/ml CNTF (Ding et al., 2013;Yang et al., 2013). TFs (BDNF,GDNF,CNTF) along with B27 were removed after 4 days culture, and siRNAs or small molecules  were added. The MNs were fed with fresh medium and re-treated with chemicals or siRNAs every 4 days. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde after a further 12 to 16 days in culture. MN survival was measured by counting Isl-RFP+ cells (H9/Isl-RFP) and Isl+/Tuj1+ cells (hiPSCs). Ara-C was used through the entire experiment. For the thapsigargin and tunicamycin MN survival assays, 1 mM of each compound (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to human MN cultures without astrocytes 3 days after dissociation. MAP4K4 inhibitor was added at the same time as the stressors. Cells were kept in culture for an additional 48 hours and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. MN survival counted as in TF survival assay, number of Isl+/Tuj1+ cells. For astrocyte co-culture, mouse glial cells were dissected from P0-P2 mouse cortices as previously described (Schildge et al.,2013). At least 2 days before MN dissociation, 5,000 glial cells per well were pre-seeded into 96-well plates. Glial cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technolgies) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (EMD Millipore).",

The spinal cords were removed and postfixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C.

Every forth section from 200 slices of each mouse was selected for Nissl staining. After being stained by 1% cresyl violet (Sigma, C5042, Saint Louis, MO, USA) for 10 minutes, the slices were dehydrated in gradient alcohol and cleared in xylol. Sample slides were observed and photographed with a microscope (Olympus, BX51, Tokyo, Japan). The motor neurons in the anterior horns of both sides were counted by a technician who was blind to the experimental design and animals grouping. The counting criteria was as follows: (i) the motor neurons in anterior horns and before the central canal; (ii) the neurons with a maximum diameter>20 \u03bcm; (iii) the neurons with a distinct nucleus.26 The average number of motor neurons was calculated based on 250 slices from five mice in each group.",

        "text": "CuII(atsm) treatment of SOD1G93A mice All research involving live mice was approved by a University of Melbourne Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee (#1312908) and conformed with guidelines of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. Hemizygous mice expressing a transgene for human SOD1 containing the G93A substitution mutation (SOD1G93A) on the mixed B6/SJL background were from the Jackson Laboratories (strain B6SJL-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1GurJ) and generously provided by Prize4Life. Non-transgenic littermates were used as a control. Prior to treating, mice were allocated based on sex and litter to either the \u201csurvival\u201d cohort or the \u201cbiochemical\u201d cohort. Mice in the survival cohort were kept through to phenotypic end-point to collect data on the effects of treatment on survival and symptom progression, and mice in the biochemical cohort were killed at the age of 120 days to collect tissues for biochemical analyses. Within each cohort individual mice were allocated based on sex and litter to either the sham treatment or the CuII(atsm) treatment group. All treatments were thus spread evenly across sexes, litters and genotypes. Treatment commenced when the mice were 50 days old. Sham treatment involved gavage with standard suspension vehicle (SSV; 0.9% w/v NaCl, 0.5% w/v Na-carboxymethylcellulose, 0.5% v/v benzyl alcohol, 0.4% v/v Tween-80). CuII(atsm) treatment involved gavage using SSV supplemented with CuII(atsm). CuII(atsm) was synthesised as described previously5,45. Dose of CuII(atsm) administered to each animal was 50\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 body weight. Treatments were administered twice daily, 7 days week\u22121 through to phenotypic end-point (survival cohort) or until the mice reached 120 days of age (biochemical cohort).",

        "text": "Animal studies Equal number of SOD1(G93A)-mutant mice of the same gender from same litter were randomly divided into two groups. Littermates with same gender were randomly assigned to each group which had 12 mice (6 male and 6 female). The strain of the mutant SOD1(G93A) mice is B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1G93A)1Gur/J (Jackson Laboratory). The mice purchased from Jackson were not used immediately. The SOD1(G93A) male from Jackson mated with wild-type C57Bl/6 female, then male offspring were always mated with wild-type C57Bl/6 female mice. The resulting animals are on a background that involves C57BL/6 and SJL and express high levels of human SOD1 gene carrying a glycine to alanine transition at position 93 (G93A). The animal protocol used was approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute. Mice were treated from postnatal day 60 until the endpoints by i.p. injections with either 123C4 or the saline control. 123C4 was dissolved in normal saline at a concentration of 2 mg/mL and sterilized by a 0.2 \u03bcm filter. Mice were treated with 123C4 every day, at a dose of 30 mg/kg of body weight. Animals were assessed daily for the time of onset of hind limb tremor and loss of splay reflex. The endpoint was designated as the point when the mouse could no longer roll over within 10s after being pushed onto its side. At this stage, mice were killed. Disease onset and survival time were compared using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. Difference of survival time from disease onset to end point between 123C4 and saline-treated mice was analyzed with Student's t-test. Values are given as mean \u00b1 SD. Preliminary BBB penetration and PK studies were performed by Agilux (Cambridge, MA).",

        "text": "Preclinical study in the SOD1G93A mouse. Starting at 98 d, SOD1G93A female mice received continuous intracerebroventricular infusions of vehicle (PBS) or MM218 inhibitor. A subcutaneously implanted osmotic minpump connected by polyvinylchloride tubing to a stainless steel cannula stereotaxically implanted into the lateral ventricle (Brain Infusion Kit 3; Alzet) was used. Mice received a subcutaneous dose (0.15 mg/kg body weight) of buprenorphine as analgesic immediately before and 12 h after the surgery. During the surgery, they were anesthesized by inhalational of isoflurane 3%. The minipump delivered vehicle or drug, 1 or 10 \u03bcm in the reservoir, for 28 d at a continuous rate of 0.11 \u03bcl/h. After 28 d, the minipump was replaced with another one to infuse the drug for a further 28 d. Pumps were weighed before implantation and at the end of the experiment to check complete delivery of their content. The effect of the MM218 inhibitor on the progression of the disease was assessed twice a week from 13 weeks of age on the basis of Rotarod performance (Pizzasegola et al., 2009). The Rotarod apparatus (Ugo Basile) was accelerated at a constant rate (4.2 rpm/min) from 7 to 28 rpm for a maximum of 5 min. The mice were given up to three attempts and the longest latency to fall was considered in statistical analysis. To observe the treatment effect at a late stage of the disease, paralysis was evaluated, assessed as the age at which the mice scored 0 in the Rotarod test, when the mice were not able to perform the test anymore. The mice were killed when they were unable to right themselves within 10 s after being placed on either side. The time was considered the end stage of the disease and was used to calculate survival. Life expectancy is considered the mean number of days of life remaining after beginning treatment.",

H i gh - cop y numb e r B6/SJ L -Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J mice [36], carrying a mutant human SOD1 gene, were obtained from Jackson Labs (stock number 002726; Bar Harbor, USA). The colony was maintained by crossing B6/SJL males carrying the SOD1 transgene with wild-type B6/SJL females. Animals were housed in a  pathogen-free environment under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with free access to food and water. Genotyping was performed from tail biopsies by a standardized PCR protocol using primers against the human SOD1 gene [11]. Treatment with E2 was carried out only with male animals in two stages of disease: pre-symptomatic (42\u201363 days old) and early symptomatic (77\u201398 days old). Transgenic and wild-type littermates were randomly subdivided into three groups: one wild-type control group (WT), a second group comprising transgenic animals (SOD1), and a third group of transgenic mice receiving E2 supplementation (SOD1 + E2). The SOD1 + E2 group received a hormone pellet (0.011 mg E2, 21-day time-release pellet (0.524 \u03bcg/day), Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) while theWTand SOD1 group was placebo treated. For subcutaneous pellet implantation procedure, a small incision was made in the dorsal neck region and the pellet was placed using a stainless steel trochar (Fig. 1a). The hormone dose was chosen to produce physiological E2 serum concentrations similar to that of sexually mature female mice, ranging from 20 to 200 pg/mL depending on the estrus cycle [37].",

Their spinal cords were harvested, fixed in 4 % (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (pH 7.4) and cryoprotected in 30 % sucrose in PBS. Twenty-five-micro meter free-floating cryosections were prepared from lumber spinal cords and stained for Iba-1, hemosiderin deposits, IgG leakage, and thionin for motor neurons in lamina X. For all histological stainings, 15 sections per group were used. After staining, sections were dehydrated in graded alcohol, cleared in xylene and coverslipped with enthelan (Merck, Germany). For Iba-1 staining, sections were dried and coverslipped with mounting media containing DAPI. Images were captured by a CCD color video camera (ProgRes C14, Jenoptic, Jena, Germany) attached to a Leica DMLB microscope (Leica, Germany) and analyzed with Image-J Software (NIH, freeware).",

Fifty-, 70-, and 90-day-old female SOD1G93A mice were injected subcutaneously with 5 mg AMD3100 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) or PBS (Biological Industries, Israel) twice a week. Mice received the treatment till the end stage of the disease, which was defined as the point at which animals could not right themselves within 30 s after being placed on their side. At that point, mice were euthanatized with Co2.. Other groups of 50-day-old SOD1G93A mice and wild type littermate (LM) mice as control were also treated with AMD3100 or PBS and sacrificed at 110 days old via i.p anesthesia administration of 100 mg/kg Ketamine (Fort Dodge, USA) and 20 mg/kg Xylazine (Merck, Germany) following trans-cardial perfusion with saline. The spinal cords that were collected from the sacrificed mice served for biochemical (five mice in each group) and histological analysis (three mice in each group). The animals were in house maintained colony. Mice were housed in standard conditions: constant temperature (22 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C), humidity (relative, 40 %), and a 12-h light/dark cycle and were allowed free access to food and water. All of the animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tel Aviv University.",

Fifteen (9 males, 6females) and 12 (7 males, 5 females) mice were treated with Bxt and vehicle, respectively. Additionally, 12 wild type mice were also divided into two groups and treated with Bxt or vehicle under the regimen previously described. Treatment begun on day 60 of life and continued until sacrifice. Animals were weighted three times per week beginning at day 60. After a 2-week training period, neuromuscular tests (Rotarod and hanging test) were recorded twice a week beginning at 9 weeks of age until the end of the experiment. A cylinder spinning at a constant speed of 12 rpm was used for the Rotarod test (Mouse Rota-Rod 47600, Ugo Basile, Argentina). On the other hand, a semi-spheric grid of 20 cm in diameter was used for the hanging test. The best of two attempts, which were separated by 10 min rest, was recorded. Following current recommendations (Vargas et al., 2013), animals were euthanized by the time they developed severe paralysis, when they were not able to straighten up after turning them on their back in the following 15 s.",

This assay measures the conversion of NAD+ to NADH when GAPDH catalyzes the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to bisphosphoglycerate. A GAPDH standard was used construct a calibration curve for each assay done in 96-well plates. A 10\u03bcl aliquot of sample tissue lysate was added to wells of a 96-well plate in triplicate. The GAPDH reaction mix containing substrates and fluorescent dye for detection are then added and the fluorescence (530 excitation, 590 emission) immediately recorded for 5 minutes in a plate reader with automatic mixing at 30\u00b0C. Reaction rates were calculated from the change in fluorescence from the 1 to 5 minutes time interval. Units of GAPDH activity were calculated from the standard curve.",

        "text": "2.2 Radioligand Binding Studies To verify that JAK4D binds to TRH receptors in human CNS tissue, radioligand binding assays were undertaken. Confirmation that a compound binds to its targeted receptor in native human tissue is critical for progression to clinical development, especially since the apparent pharmacology of recombinant receptors may not reflect that of the native human target (George et al., 2002).[3H][3-Me-His2]TRH (NET 705, 57.4-62.0 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer, UK) was used to label TRH receptors in human hippocampal and pituitary tissue from individual non-identifiable donors aged 45-55 years with no history of neurological disease. These tissues were kindly donated to The University of Miami Brain Endowment Bank. Membranes from these tissues were prepared at the University of Miami and purchased from Tissue Solutions Limited, Scotland. Membranes were prepared essentially as described by (Hirst et al., 2000) except homogenization and resuspension buffers were the same as those we employed previously (Hogan et al., 2008; Kelly et al., 2005, 2002). Membranes were stored at -80 \u00b0C pending assay. Binding assays were conducted essentially as previously described (Hogan et al., 2008; Kelly et al., 2005, 2002). All assays were carried out at 4\u00b0C in 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 177 \u03bcM bacitracin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. In saturation binding experiments approximately 225 \u03bcg of membrane protein were incubated in triplicate with increasing concentrations of [3H][3-Me-His2]TRH (0.6 - 20 nM) for 5 h in a final volume of 100\u03bcl. Non-specific binding (NSB) was determined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM TRH. Competition experiments were conducted under similar conditions by incubating membrane suspensions in either duplicate (pituitary) or triplicate (hippocampus) with 10-12 nM [3H][3-Me- His2]TRH and increasing concentrations of competitor (10-10 to 10-3 M TRH or JAK4D). Competitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 10-2 M and diluted with assay buffer such that the final concentration of DMSO in all samples did not exceed 1%, a concentration at which specific binding of [3H][3-Me-His2]TRH is not affected (Kelly et al., 2002). Bound and free ligand were separated by vacuum filtration using a Brandel CellHarvester and GF/B filters washed with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl solution. The radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting in a TRI-Carb 2100 TR Packard Liquid Scintillation Analyzer. Protein was measured by the method of Bradford.",

        "text": "2.4 Systemic Kainate (KA) Model Neuroprotective effects of JAK4D were initially assessed in a rat model of kainate (KA)-induced neurodegeneration: systemic administration of the excitotoxic glutamate analog KA was used to produce deficits in learning and memory characteristic of human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and the ability of JAK4D to improve functional recovery from KA-induced learning deficits was evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM) test (D\u2019Hooge and De Deyn, 2001; Gobbo and O\u2019Mara, 2005). Male Wistar rats (approximately 250 g) (Comparative Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland) na\u00efve to drug treatment were used. Three independent experiments were undertaken by threedifferent investigators blinded to treatment. Rats were randomly assigned to five different groups. On Day 1 of the experiment, all animals received two i.p. injections. Two groups received saline and three groups received KA (AG Scientific, USA) (12mg/kg i.p. in saline). Two hours later the two saline groups received a second injection of either saline or DMSO:saline (40:60), and the three groups receiving KA were administered either saline, DMSO:saline (40:60) or JAK4D (1mg/kg i.p. in DMSO:saline 40:60). KA-treated rats were observed to develop characteristic KA-induced behaviors, including wet-dog shakes, head bobbing, forelimb clonus, foaming at mouth and seizures, for 2-3 h following KA injection. One animal died within the first 24 h following KA treatment. Following day one, all animals were allowed to recover for 3 days before commencement of MWM testing. During this time, animals were given a daily injection as per their second injection on day one, i.e., either saline, DMSO:saline (40:60) or JAK4D (1mg/kg i.p. in DMSO:saline 40:60). On Day 4, testing was commenced using standard MWM trials as previously described (Gobbo and O\u2019Mara, 2005). Daily injections of treatments as above were continued through the second day of water maze testing. Each animal undertook 5 trials per day, with approximately 20 sec between each trial, for 5 consecutive days. Swim paths, escape latency and swim speed were recorded by an automated tracking system (EthoVision; Noldus, Wageningen, Netherlands). On the day following the last day of escape latency testing, a probe test was carried out to assess reference memory at the end of learning (Vorhees and Williams, 2006). In this test the platform was removed from the pool and rats were placed in the pool and allowed to swim for a 60 sec period. Swim paths were digitally tracked and total time spent in the former zone of the platform was recorded.Statistical analyses of MWM data were performed by an independent biostatistician. Data from the three independent experiments were pooled and analyzed with ANOVA using SPSS with factors representing Day, Group and Day x Group interactions. Since there was no heterogeneity between control groups in which animals received a first injection of saline followed by a second injection of either saline (n=13) or DMSO:saline (40:60) (n=9), these were collapsed for analysis. Likewise, data from the two groups receiving KA followed by saline (n=10) or DMSO:saline (40:60) (n=13) were also collapsed for analysis. A repeated measures design was used, employing the Greenhouse-Geisser three-step approach to significance testing where relevant. In this case, we report the uncorrected degrees of freedom, the corrected p value and the epsilon value of the correction factor. Post hoc tests were calculated to follow up significant effects",

        "text": "2.5 Intrastriatal Microdialysis KA Model The formation of highly reactive oxygen species (hROS), which provides a measure of oxidative stress commonly associated with the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders (Cavalli  et al., 2008; Freinbichler et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2008), can be evoked in a dose-dependent manner by local application of an excitotoxic concentration of KA into rat striatum. hROS can be sensitively quantified as OH-TA, the hydroxylated derivative of sodium terephthalate (TA2-) (Freinbichler et al., 2011, 2008). This method was used to assess the ability of JAK4D to protect against in vivo free radical formation induced by intrastriatal administration of KA (1 mM) during brain microdialysis. Histochemical ex vivo tissue analysis was employed to assess related apoptotic striatal tissue damage.  Male Wistar rats (200-220 g) anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg i.p.) were placed in a stereotaxic frame. A microdialysis guide cannula (concentric design, CMA/Microdialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) was implanted vertically in the right neostriatum (stereotaxic coordinates for neostriatum, relative to Bregma, were AP 0.7, L 3.2, DV 5.5 mm). Appoximately 48 h later, microdialysis experiments were performed on freely-moving rats, always starting at 9:00 am, by inserting the microdialysis probe (4mm exposed surface; CMA/Microdialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) into the guide cannula. The perfusion fluid, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), comprised: 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM Na2HPO4, 0.27 mM NaH2PO4 and 7.2 mM glucose (pH 7.4), plus 1 mM sodium terephthalate (TA2-) used as a chemical trap for highly reactive oxygen species (hROS) (Freinbichler et al., 2011).  After a 60 min stabilization period, the dialysate samples were collected every 20 min. Initially, two fractions were collected to determine basal levels. At 60 min, the two KA-treated groups received an i.p. injection of either vehicle (15% DMSO in saline) or JAK4D (10 mg/kg in vehicle); the control group, not receiving KA, was administered JAK4D i.p. (10 mg/kg in vehicle). The rats were anesthetized (chloral hydrate 400 mg/kg i.p.) just before KA (1 mM) was applied to the neostriatum for 20 min from 100-120 min through the dialysis probe to the two KA-treated groups. Reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of 2-hydroxyterephthalate (OH-TA) in microdialysates was carried out using a Shimadzu instrument (Italia S.r.l., Milan, Italy) with a fluorescence detector (\u03bbex = 315 nm; \u03bbem = 435 nm) (Freinbichler et al., 2011).",

After 6 h, the cell-culture medium was replaced with fresh D-MEM and culture and allowed to proceed for a further 42 h. The cells were then transferred to serum-free D-MEM and immediately treated with SA4503 at a final concentration of 1, 3, or 10 nM. SA4503 was synthesized and gifted by M\u2019s Science Corporation (Kobe, Japan). We also used BD1047 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA; concentration, 3  M), a sigma-1 receptor antagonist, to investigate whether the effect of SA4503 was inhibited by BD1047. Recent studies in the causes of ALS are focused on not only genetic mutation but also abnormalities of neuronal cell metabolism involving glutamate, the role of potential neurotoxins, the deficiency of neurotrophic factors and so on [30]. ALS diseases are caused by various factors. Therefore, in the present study, we used the previous methods using not only SOD1G93A but also serum-free stress as in vitro models of ALS to evaluate the motor neurons toxicity in the pathology of ALS and to simulate the stress condition of genetic mutation and deficiency of neurotrophic factors [24,26]. Cell death was assessed using combination staining with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (PI) performed 27 h after the addition of the SA4503. Images were collected by means of an Olympus IX70 inverted epifluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The total number of cells was counted, and the percentage of PI-positive cells was calculated as a measure of dead cells, as described previously [23]. In a blind manner, at least 200 cells per condition were counted using image-processing software (Image-J ver. 1.33f; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). 2.3.",

To investigate the effect of SA4503 on phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated ERK, and the expression of the sigma-1 receptor, two treatment groups with differing components were prepared: (1) vehicle containing 1% FBS and (2) SA4503 (1, 3, or 10  M). At the end of the culture period, the NSC34 cells were washed with PBS twice to remove dead cells. The NSC34 cells were then lysed using a cell lysis buffer (RIPA buffer: 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1% Igepal CA-630), together with protease inhibitors (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma\u2013Aldrich). The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. The protein concentration was determined from a standard curve of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). A mixture of equal parts of a protein sample and sample buffer with 20% 2-mercaptoethanol (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was subjected to 5\u201320% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Wako). The separated protein was then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF, Immobilon-P; Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA). To visualize the proteins on the membrane, the following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (#4058, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA), rabbit anti-Akt (#9272, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (#4377, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (#9102, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-sigma-1 receptor (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and mouse anti- -actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma\u2013Aldrich). The secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse HARP-conjugated and goat anti-rabbit HARP-conjugated (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The immunoreactive bands were visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate (ImmunoStar\u00ae LD; Wako). The band intensity was measured using an imaging analyzer (LAS-4000; Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).",

To train the mice to the apparatus, they were allowed to adjust to balancing on the rod as it rotated for 600 seach time for a week from the time they were 5 weeks old. Each experimental session consisted of three trials (10 min/trial; intervals between trials 2 min), and the best performance of the three trials was recorded. We performed these sessions once a week from the time the animals were 5\u20139 weeks and then twice a week until the animals were close to death. Death was taken as an animal\u2019s inability to right itself after 15 s. The date on which the animal died indicated the experimental endpoint, and that date was recorded.",

Carboxy-H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes, Paisley, UK) was added to NSC34 cells to a final  concentration of 5 \u03bcM, and DCF fluorescence was read at Ex485 nm/Em530nm after 1 hour. Cell death was simultaneously measured by adding ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD1, 0.3 \u03bcM, Molecular Probes) to the culture medium, and the fluorescence was measured at Ex530 nm/Em645 nm. When different cell lines were compared, the DCF results were normalised to the cell number, which was determined by measuring EthD1 fluorescence after the cells had been freeze-thawed.",

The ADP-Glo\u2122 Kinase Assay \u00fe CDC7/DBF4 Kinase Enzyme System (no. catalog V5089) from Promega was used to determine the activity of selected compounds against CDC7. ATP and other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The assays were performed in a buffer solution using 96-well plates. The compound to be tested (5 mL, 40 mMdissolved in 4% DMSO)was added to each well followed by the enzyme (5 mL, 25 ng/well), ATP (5 mL, final concentration in the well 10 mM) and PDKtidE (5 mL, 4 mg/ well). Then it was allowed to incubate for 60 min at room temperature and ADP-Glo\u2122 reagent (20 mL) was added allowing to incubate again for 40 min at room temperature. Behind the incubation, the kinase detection agent (40 mL)was added and allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the luminescence was recorded using a FLUOstar Optima (BMG Labtechnologies GmbH, Offenburg, Germany) multimode reader. The inhibition activities were calculated based on the maximum activity, measured in the absence of inhibitor. To evaluate the mechanism of CDC7 inhibition of the compounds, ATP-dependent kinetic experiments were performed. CDC7 activity was measured at four different concentrations of ATP (1 100 mM) in the absence or presence of the inhibitors, at two concentrations. The results are presented as double reciprocal Lineweaver Burk plots (1/V vs 1/ [S]).\n",

The cuticle-defective bus-8(e2692) mutation is included to enhance small molecule entry into the animals [57]. To conduct the screen, 6 mL of nematode growth medium (NGM) were added into 60 mm culture dishes. Each well was seeded with 200 mL of 10x concentrated OP-50 E. coli. After the bacterial lawn dried, bacteria were killed by UV irradiation to minimize metabolism of test compounds by live bacteria. Serial dilutions in DMSO of each drug in 40 mL total volumes were added to each plate, to the indicated final concentrations. Approximately 100 C. elegans eggs were plated and grown for 6 days at 20  C, then harvested. C. elegans protein immunoblotting was performed as previously described [58]. Samples were loaded and resolved on precast 4e15% gradient SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membrane as recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). On immunoblots, TDP-43 phosphorylated at S409/S410 was detected by a monoclonal antibody anti-phospho TDP-43 (pS409/410) (Cosmobio TIP-PTD-M01). C. elegans b-tubulin levels were measured using monoclonal antibody E7 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) as a loading control. Dilutions for all primary antibodies were: 1:5000.

Wild-type and Prp-hTDP-43(A315T) transgenic littermate sibling mice were bred in house from initial breeders purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Mice were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle in a temperature-controlled atmosphere (22 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) with food and water ad libitum. Offspring were genotyped as previously described [44], and male mice randomly divided into four groups (n = 8). Compound 22 was dissolved in 2,9% DMSO and Tween 80-saline buffer (1:16) and administered intraperitoneally, starting at the age of 65 days old, at a dose of 5 mg/kg daily until sacrifice at the age of 95 days old. Vehicle injections were administered to control animals. During all the treatment, we also recorded the physical appearance and the animal weight gain. After 30 days of chronic treatment wild-type and Prp-hTDP-43 (A315T) transgenic mice were sacrificed 24 h after the last injection.

        "text": "Primary and secondary screens\nRRL in vitro translation reactions were performed in white, flat bottom, polypropylene 384-well plates from Greiner (catalogue no. 784075). RRL reaction mixture was prepared using Promega's Flexi System (catalogue no. L4540) and consisted of 30% RRL, 10 \u03bcm minus leucine amino acid mix, 10 \u03bcm minus methionine amino acid mix, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium chloride, 4 units of murine RNase inhibitor (New England Biolabs, catalogue no. M0314L), and 0.05% Tween 20. The addition of Tween 20 was necessary to minimize adhesion of the reaction mixture to the multidrop tubing and even dispensing between wells and did not alter the levels of translation from the +1 CGG RAN or AUG-NLuc reporter RNAs (Fig. S1B). 4 \u03bcl of RRL mixture was dispensed per well using Thermo Labsystems multidrop plate dispenser at medium speed. 50 nl of DMSO was then multidropped into columns 1 and 2, and 50 nl of cycloheximide was added to columns 23 and 24, for a final concentration of 3 \u03bcm. To the remaining wells, 50 nl of 3,253 compounds, at 2 mm, from the Pilot LOPAC, Pilot Prestwick, Pilot NCC Focused, and Navigator pathway libraries were pintooled using a Sciclone ALH 300 advanced liquid handling system, for a final concentration of 20 \u03bcm. 1 \u03bcl (3 fmol of +1 CGG RAN, 1 fmol of AUG-NLuc) in vitro transcribed reporter RNA was then multidropped into each well.\n\nPlates were incubated for 30 min at 30 \u00b0C. Translation reactions were then terminated by the addition of 50 nl of 10 \u03bcm cycloheximide to each well, using a multidrop dispenser. 10 \u03bcl of room temperature Glo Lysis Buffer (Promega, catalogue no. E2661) was dispensed into each well with the multidrop, at low speed, which was essential for maintaining the stability of NLuc luminescence. To this, 5 \u03bcl of room temperature NanoGlo Substrate diluted 1:50 in NanoGlo Buffer (Promega, catalogue no. N1120) was dispensed via multidrop at low speed. Plates were then covered, mixed gently, and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Luminescence was measured with a PerkinElmer EnVision plate reader.\n\nThe concentration-response curve and counterscreen were performed using all of the same reagents, materials, and equipment as in the primary screen. The only difference was that selected compounds were added to 384-well plates at eight doses from 50 to 8 \u03bcm, in duplicate, using TTP Labtech Mosquito X1 Hit-Picking Liquid Handler, prior to the addition of RRL.\n\nAfter measuring luminescence, pIC50 values were calculated through the University of Michigan's Center for Chemical Genomics' MScreen software, using a four-parameter logistic equation (43). Initial minimum limits for curve fits were informed by the minimum value of each plate, determined by the cycloheximide-treated internal positive controls. Regression analysis then derived a curve fit, with a calculated minimum and maximum limit, for each compound. IC50 values greater than the maximum dose in the assay (50 \u03bcm) were extrapolated from the curve fit.",

For in vitro translation assays, compounds were diluted in DMSO and added to RRL for a final DMSO concentration of 1% of total reaction volume. mRNAs were in vitro translated with the Flexi Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System from Promega, as performed for the primary screen, with a few slight modifications. First, 0.05% Tween 20 was excluded from reactions, as regular pipetting eliminated the need to prevent RRL adhesion to multidrop dispenser tubing. Additionally, the reaction volume was increased to 10 \u03bcl, with an RNA concentration of 0.6 nm. Incubations were performed in polypropylene PCR tubes, and reactions were terminated on ice and then transferred to black 96-well plates. Samples were diluted 1:7 in Glo Lysis Buffer (Promega) prior to 5 min incubation in the dark with NanoGlo Substrate freshly diluted 1:50 in NanoGlo Buffer (Promega). Luminescence was measured on a GloMax 96 microplate luminometer.\n\nReactions for Western blotting assays were performed as above, except 50 ng of mRNA was used, as described previously (27). Membranes were probed with the following antibodies: 1:1,000 FLAG-M2 (mouse; Sigma, F1804), 1:1,000 GAPDH 6C5 (mouse; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., sc32233).",

The spinal samples (lumbar area) to be used for histology were fixed for 1 day at 4\u00b0C in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde prepared in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4. Samples were then cryoprotected by immersion in a 30% sucrose solution for a further day, and finally stored at \u221280\u00b0C for Nissl staining and immunohistochemical analysis. The spinal samples (also lumbar area) to be used for biochemistry were collected and maintained for 24 h at 4\u00b0C in RNAlater (Thermo\u2010Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) before being frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for analysis of different markers by qPCR and for glutamate content by using a commercial kit. In the three experiments, we examined the intestinal tract of each animal to exclude those cases in which a premature intestinal lesion might have influenced our results. However, we did not find any intestinal lesions in animals younger than 110 days after birth, according to the data published by Esmaeili et al. (2013). In all experiments, at least 10 animals were used per experimental group, except a few analyses included fewer numbers, but always greater than five animals per group (indicated for each parameter in the legends to figures).",

After preincubation for 1 h with Tris\u2010buffered saline with 1% Triton X\u2010100 (pH 7.5), sections were sequentially incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with a polyclonal anti\u2010Iba\u20101 (1:500; Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VI, USA) or polyclonal anti\u2010GFAP (1:200; Dako Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), followed by washing in Tris\u2010buffered saline and incubation (at 37\u00b0C for 2 h) with an anti\u2010rabbit secondary antibody made in donkey (1:200; Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA), conjugated with Alexa 488 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) rendering green fluorescence for anti\u2010Iba\u20101, or conjugated with Alexa 546 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) rendering red fluorescence for anti\u2010GFAP (except in the double\u2010labelling analysis and the immunostaining for exploring the activated state of GFAP\u2010positive cells, which were carried out with green fluorescence as for Iba\u20101). For quantification, high\u2010resolution digital microphotographs were taken with the 10\u00d7 objective under the same conditions of light and brightness/contrast. They were used to measure the mean density of labelling in a selected area, using the ImageJ software (U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997\u20132012). All data were expressed in arbitrary units. For quantification of the glial activation state, we classified the GFAP\u2010 or Iba\u20101\u2010positive cells as resting or activated based on morphological criteria published previously (Guida et al., 2015) or by calculating the ratio between cell body area and cell process length following the procedure published by Cepri\u00e1n et al. (2017). Both procedures led to equivalent results. For double\u2010labelling analyses, sections were then washed again and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with a polyclonal anti\u2010CB2 receptor (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

After incubation at 30\u00b0C for 1.5 h, ice-cold assay buffer (3 mL) was added and the samples were vacuum-filtered through Whatman GF/C filters (pre-treated with 0.05 % polyethylenimine in water for 30 minutes) and washed twice with ice-cold assay buffer (3 mL). Activity trapped on the filter was measured using a Beckman LS 6500 Liquid Scintillation Counter upon addition of 3 mL scintillation cocktail (Ultima Gold, Perkin Elmer). Three experiments each in triplicate were performed to obtain the mean IC50 value of each ligand to test. Using the Cheng-Prusoff equation, inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated from the mean IC50 values [40]. For the calculations, Kd values of 0.14 nM (hCB1) and 0.11 nM (hCB2)provided by PerkinElmer were used.",

It was synthesized as previously described (Woodruff et al., 2005) and purified by reverse\u2010phase HPLC. For early treatment, PMX205 was administered to mice via their drinking water (20 or 60 \u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121). Based on drinking water measurements taken in hSOD1G93A mice, these dosages equated to 3 and 9 mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121 respectively. Litter\u2010matched female hSOD1G93A transgenic mice were treated with PMX205 or distilled water alone (vehicle) from 35 days postnatal (termed \u2018pre\u2010onset\u2019).

All drug treatments were continued daily throughout until the end\u2010stage of disease (i.e. point of euthanasia). Prior to study commencement, a power analysis was performed on data obtained from previous hSOD1G93A x C5aR1\u2212/\u2212 mice survival studies (Woodruff et al., 2014), resulting in a sample size of n = 13 (power 80%, \u03b1 0.05, effect size 5%), which was used in the efficacy trials. In the post\u2010onset group, two mice from each group died during the trial due to non\u2010ALS pathologies. According to the ALS preclinical guidelines (Ludolph et al., 2007; Scott et al., 2008), the matched littermate was also removed from the trial, thus resulting in a final n = 9 for these groups. To avoid any potential bias, all drug and vehicle treatments were coded and then administered and subsequently analysed by a researcher (J.D.L.) blinded to the treatment groups. Decoding only occurred after each animal experiment was completed.",

Mice were killed by cervical dislocation following anaesthesia (i.p. injection of tiletamine 50 mg\u00b7kg\u22121, zolazepam 50 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 and xylazine 12 mg\u00b7kg\u22121).",

A digital force gauge (Ugo Basile) was used to measure maximal hindlimb muscle grip strength as described previously (Lee et al., 2013). Mice were held by their tail and lowered until their hindlimbs grasped the T\u2010bar connected to the digital force gauge. The tail was then lowered until the body was horizontal with the apparatus, and the mice were pulled away from the T\u2010bar with a smooth steady motion until both of their hindlimbs released the bar. The strength of the grip was measured in gram force. Each mouse was given 10 attempts and the maximum grip strength from these attempts recorded.",

        "text": "Neural Stem Cell Proliferation Assay: Neurogenic properties of small molecules are determined based on the proliferation of human embryonic stem cell derived neural stem cells (NSCs), which were derived via a dual smad inhibition. Compound response is measured by the increase in cells based on ATP levels (Promega:CellTiterGlo) after an incubation period of 4 days. NSCs are thawed and expanded over three passages. On the 14th day, NSCs are seeded in Polyornithin/Laminin coated 384-well plates at a cell density of 21,000 cells/cm2 in a media volume of 38 \u03bcL. Four hours after cell seeding, compound solutions are added at a volume of 2 \u03bcL. Stock solutions of the compounds (water, 5% DMSO) are diluted to obtain a dose response (11 points, dilution factor is 2), ranging from 8 \u03bcM to 8 nM. Controls are run to consistently determine the neurogenic properties of the cells. Negative (neutral) control is cell culture media (final DMSO concentration: 0.25%).Positive controls are 1.Cell culture media + 100 ng/mL FGF2 (final DMSO concentration: 0.1%). 2.Cell culture media + 20 ng/mL EGF (final DMSO concentration: 0.1%). 3.Cell culture media + 100 ng/mL Wnt3a (final DMSO concentration: 0.1%). After 4 days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2, the amount of ATP per well is quantified. The ATP concentration is proportional to the cell number. ATP is quantified by using the Promega CellTiterGlo kit. The CellTiterGlo reagents contain a cell lysis buffer, thermostable luciferase (UltraGloTM recombinant luciferase), magnesium, and luciferin. Luciferin reacts with ATP producing oxyluciferin, AMP, and light. The luminescence signal is proportional to the ATP content. The value of negative (neutral) control is determined for each assay plate by taking the average of 16 negative control wells. The neurogenic compound response is calculated for each compound as (compound/negative control) \u00d7 100. The values of EC150 from the dose response curve are determined for each test compound. The EC150 is the compound concentration at which 150% activity of control (100%) is reached. The preferred compounds show a EC150 (\u03bc\u039c) in the range of < 3.0 \u03bc\u039c as shown in Table 1. List of examples, compound name and EC150(uM)",

Glow-type luminescence was recorded after 10 min using a FLUOstar Optima (BMG Labtechnologies GmbH, Offenburg, Germany) multimode reader. The activity is proportional to the difference of the total and consumed ATP. The inhibitory activities were calculated on the basis of maximal activities measured in the absence of inhibitor.

To train the mice to the apparatus, they were allowed to adjust to balancing on the rod as it rotated for 600 s each time for a week from 4 weeks old. After this period of adaptation, rotarod performance on the rod was evaluated starting at 5 weeks old. Each experimental session consisted of three trials (10 min per trial; intervals between trials 2 min), and the best performance of three trials was recorded. We performed such sessions once a week from 5 to 9 weeks old, and then twice a week until the animals became moribund. The disease onset was defined as the day when a mouse first dropped off the rotarod within 600 s, as described previously (Shimazawa et al., 2010; Tanaka et al., 2012). The age of death was taken as an animal\u2019s inability to right itself after 15 s. The date on which the animal showed signs of dying indicated the experimental endpoint, and that date was recorded.",

A 12 h light\u2212dark cycle was maintained, and animals were given free access to food and water.Control and transgenic mice of the same age (\u00b13 days) and from the same \u201cf\u201d generation were selected from multiple litters to form experimental cohorts (n = 20 per group). Standardized criteria for age, weight, and parentage were used for placing individual mice into experimental groups/cohorts. Wild type mice were used for initial toxicity, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics studies. The tolerable dose range and LD50 for 13 was determined in the wild type mice by increasing the dose b.i.d. 1-fold each injection and observed at 75 mg/kg. Drug steady-state level was determined in animals that had been dosed for 1 week prior to sacrifice. The dosing levels of 1.0, 10, and 20mg/kg once a day were administered throughout the levels of the G93A mice.Efficacy was measured using end points that clearly indicate neuroprotective function. These include amelioration of degenerative changes in the spinal cord, improved motor function, and prolonged survival. The mice cohorts were sacrificed at end stage disease using criteria for euthanasia, followed temporally for survival analyses. Mice were observed three times daily (morning, noon, and later afternoon) throughout the experiment. Mice were euthanized when disease progression was sufficiently severe that they were unable to initiate movement and right themselves after gentle prodding for 30 s.Data sets were generated and analyzed for each clinical and neuropathological measure. Effects on behavior and neuropathology were compared in treatment and control groups. Dose-dependent effects were assessed in each treatment group using multiple two-sided ANOVA tests. Multiple comparisons in the same subject groups were dealt with post hoc. Kaplan\u2212Meier analysis was used for survival function. All other statistical analyses were performed using Student\u2019s  test. Data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical comparisons of histological data were made by ANOVA.",

        "text": "4.13. General Procedures for In Vivo Experiments. Male transgenic ALS mice of the G93 A H1 high-expressor strain (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were bred with females having a similar background (B6/SJLF1). Offspring were genotyped using a PCR assay on tail DNA. To ensure homogeneity of the cohorts tested, we developed a standardized method by which to select mice. Mice were randomized from 24 litters all within 4 days of age from the same \u2018f\u2019 generation removed from the founding mice in our colony. Bodyweights were taken at 20 days, and mice were equally distributed according to weight within each experimental cohort. Mice under 8 g at 20 days were excluded from the experiments. Only male mice were used in the treatment studies because we have observed gender differences in survival in the G93A transgenic ALS mouse model.9 These experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and were approved by both the Veterans Administration and the University Animal Care Committees. Based upon previous studies,10,11 a dose\u2013response study was performed. Groups (n = 10) of wild-type (WT), untreated G93A, and G93A mice received 1, 10, and 20 mg/kg of 26 injected intraperitoneally once a day in the morning. Mice were observed twice daily, morning and afternoon, for any adverse events. Compound 26 was dissolved in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% DMSO, and fresh solutions were prepared daily. Treatment was started at 42 days, as our studies demonstrate that clinical disease onset begins on or about this age. The ALS mice were euthanized when they were unable to right themselves after being placed on their back for 30 s. Some deaths occurred overnight and were recorded the following morning. Two independent observers who were blinded to the treatment assignment agreed when animals should be euthanized. Survival data were analyzed by means of Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves.",

TW150F borosilicate capillary glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and a programmable horizontal P-97 flaming/brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA) were employed to obtain the patch pipettes. The internal (pipette) solution contained (in mM): 110 KCl, 10 HEPES, 5 K4BAPTA, 5 K2ATP, and 1 MgCl2 (pH 7.2 with KOH). The external (bath) solution included (in mM): 130 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). The resistance of the micropipettes filled with the internal solution was 1.5\u20132.5 M\u03a9.

At DIV, 7 cells were treated with latrepirdine (0.1 nM), or rapamycin (200 nM) or vehicle for 24 hours and cathepsin inhibitors pepstatin A and E64D (Calbiochem, Merck Biosciences, Nottingham, UK) for 23 hours. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 12 minutes at 37  C. Coverslips were washed 3 times and permeabilised with 0.1% PBS-tritonX-100. Cells were blocked in 5% goat serum (Sigma), immunostained with primary antibodies; SMI-32 (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and LC3II (1:100; Sigma) and incubated with Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (488 nm and 568 nm, 1:500; Biosciences) and coverslips again washed thoroughly. Motor neurons were imaged on an LSM 510 Meta Zeiss confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a 63  NA 1.4 oil immersion objective. Three-dimensional stacks of optical slices were taken with a distance of 0.27 mm and optical slice thickness of 1.1 mm. Processing of immunofluorescence images corresponded to single motoneuron cells (SMI-32) and autophagic vesicles (LC3) in that area and was quantified using CellProfiler (version 2.0, http://www.cellprofiler.org/). Maximum intensity projections were processed from each stack. From those, local background was calculated using local minima (75   75 pixel window for SMI-32 and 15  15 for LC3, respectively) interpolation and subtracted from the raw images. Cells were isolated from background-corrected SMI-32 images using uniform smoothing (15   15 pixel window) followed by Otsu thresholding (2-class, variance ratio minimization). Binary masks corresponding to adjacent vesicles were split using Euclidean distance transform followed by watershedding. Holes in the masks were filled using morphologic operations, and the masks touching the image edges were rejected from further analysis. Sizes of those masks were measured in pixels and converted to physical areas each representing a cell. The intensity of LC3was measured and integrated for each cell (SMI-32 image). Vesicles were segmented using Otsu thresholding combined with watershedding on the intensity image, assigned to the corresponding masks, and counted on cell-by-cell basis.",

The spinal cord was dissected and post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The lumbar spinal cord was paraffin embedded and sectioned at a thickness of 8 lm. To quantify the number of motor neurons, every 13th section was selected, with a total of 30 sections being collected for each animal. The spinal cord sections were immunostained with an antibody recognizing the neuron-specific protein, neuronal nuclei (NeuN) (ZhongShan JinQiao, Beijing, China), followed by quantification of the number of neurons under a Leica microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). In each mouse (three mice per group), large motor neurons (NeuN immunoreactive) with a clear nucleus and nucleolus were counted in the ventral horn of the lumbar spinal cord (six sections per mouse). The number of motor neurons was determined by an experienced pathologist who was blinded to the sample groups.",

At a predetermined treatment time point of 60 days, some mice in various groups (NTG-Veh n = 3, NTG-OMT n = 3, G93A-Veh n = 4, and G93A-OMT n = 4) were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with normal saline; a part of the lumbar spinal cord approximately 3 mm thick was harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h. The tissues was dehydrated in 30% sucrose overnight at 4 and then embedded in OCT. Finally, transverse sections were cut at 25 lm thickness using a Leica cryostat (CM1850).Three sections from the animals of various groups were incubated with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min and then blocked with 5% donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h. The sections were treated with the following primaryantibodies overnight at 4  C: rabbit anti-NeuN (Sigma-Aldrich, ABN78, 1:100), mouse anti-GFAP (Millipore, MAB360, 1:500), and rabbit anti-IBA-1 (Wako Chemicals, 019\u201319741, 1:250). Then, the sections were incubated with a corresponding secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 or 594, Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA) for 2 h. Finally, the nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector, Vectashield H-1200). Three representative images of the lumbar ventral horns from each tested animal of all experimental groups were acquired by a laser scanning microscope (Zeiss Vert. A1, German) and used for quantitative measurements of motor neurons. Motor neurons were defined according to the following criteria: (1) neurons were located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and were NeuN+ and (2) neurons with a diameter of 20 lm or larger had a distinct nucleolus (Manabe et al., 2003). The numbers of motor neurons in the ventral horn area were calculated using ImageJ software. The data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean(SEM) of cells per section. Quantitative assessment of glial labeling was performed using the relative numbers of glia within a unit of area and the mean integrated density of pixel measurements in the ventral horn as described by Manabe Y et al. (Manabe et al., 2003). The relative numbers and integrated pixel density were calculated for each section.

At the end of the treatment, ten wr mice (for each group) and the same number of vehicle-treated healthy mice were sacrificed by transcardiac perfusion with 0.1 M PBS pH 7.4 followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, under deep anaesthesia with an overdose of ketamine (75 mg/kg)-medetotimine (1 mg-kg). Immediately after perfusion, spinal cord was rapidly removed and post-fixed for 4 h in the same fixative (4 \u00b0C). All tissues were dehydrated and cryoprotected with serial steps in 20% and 30% sucrose in 0.1M PBS at 4 \u00b0C until they sank, frozen in n-pentane at \u221245 \u00b0C and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis.For biochemical analyses, anesthetized animals were sacrificed by decapitation; then cervical spinal cord was quickly dissected, snapfrozen on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. Histological analyseswere performed on cryostat sections of cervicalspinal cord (C2\u2013C6 level), serially cut (30\u03bcmof thickness) and processed as previously described (Bigini et al., 2006). ForNISSL staining, themean number of surviving ventral horn motor neurons (large-sized neurons with area N250 \u03bcm2) for each animal was calculated on at least 30 NISSL-stained sections, interspaced of 90 \u03bcm, to avoid counting the same neurons twice. The analysis was performed by an automatic cell segmentation software (TissueQuest analysis software, TissueGnostics, Vienna, Austria) as previously described (Bigini et al., 2010).Gliosis was evaluated in PRE-084-treated (n = 6) and vehicletreated wr mice (n = 6) on 20 serial slices (1 sample out of five sectioned) belonging to the same spinal region utilized forMNcounting. Immunostaining for bothGFAP and CD11bwas carried out as previouslyreported (Bigini et al., 2008) using a mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody (Immunological Science; dilution 1:5000) and a ratmonoclonal anti-CD11b antibody (Serotec; dilution 1:300). The quantification of glial proliferation was carried out, by the same operator blinded to treatment, by determining the number of GFAP+ and CD11b+ cells in representative areas close to the ventral horns as previously described (Bigini et al., 2008; Park et al., 2003). In addition, since the hypertrophy of glial cells is another important parameter of activation, the relative surface occupied by the staining (expressed as percentage respect to the total squared area) was calculated for both GFAP and CD11b markers. This analysis was carried out by determining a threshold value within a gray-scale (corresponding to the maximum level of an unstained section\u2014background) and considering as positive events all the pixels falling over this value.

        "text": "Quantitative evaluation of co-localization between stainings. Co-localization between stainings (e.g. S1R and KDEL)was performedthrough intensity correlation analysis (ICA) by applying an algorithm ofImageJ (public domain software) developed by Li et al. (2004). Thisalgorithm is based on the assumption that if two proteins are partsof the same complex or compartment, then their staining intensitiesshould vary in synchrony (dependent staining). Whereas, if theyare in different compartments, their staining intensity will changeasynchronously (segregated staining). Therefore, when a pixel'sintensity (Ri) is below average in the red channel (i.e. Ri\u2014Rmean b 0);it will be below average also in the green channel (i.e. Gi\u2014Gmean b 0)and viceversa pixels above average in one channel will be above averagealso in the other. If their intensities vary together, the product of thedifferences from the mean (PDM) will be positive. On the contrary, ifthe pixel intensities vary asynchronously, the PDMs will be negative.The algorithm (Li et al., 2004) calculates the intensity correlationquotient (ICQ) where: ICQ = number of positive PDM/total number ofpixels. The ICQ values are distributed between \u22120.5 and +0.5 bysubtracting 0.5 from this ratio. For random staining: ICQ~ 0; segregatedstaining: ICQ iswithin the range of\u22120.5 to 0; dependent staining: ICQ iswithin the range of 0 to +0.5. To analyze S1R and KDEL co-localization,3 cervical spinal cord sections (interspaced of 600\u03bcm) from 6week-oldhealthy controls (CTR, n=3) and wr mice (n=3) were stained withS1R, KDEL and Neurotrace fluorescent NISSL stain, as described above.Images were acquired at 40\u00d7 magnification through a laser scanningconfocal microscope keeping constant acquisition parameters betweengroups. Image layers selected for analysis were converted into 8-bitmonochromatic images. ROIs surrounding the motor neuronal cellbodies were outlined based on Neurotrace stain. Then, fluorescenceintensity for S1R and KDEL channels was quantified in matched ROIsfor each pair of images by using the ICA algorithm (Li et al., 2004). ICQvalues for each cell from CTR and wr sections were considered inthe analysis.",

For theLPS-induced neurotoxic model, cultures were exposed to 1  g/mLLPS (from E. coli 0111:B4) for 24 h. To assess the effect of theTLR4 antagonists, a pretreatment with different concentrations ofIAXO102, FP7 or phenolic extract of EVOO was performed for 2 h;then, co-treatment with LPS was prolonged for further 24 h. Forthe SOD1mut glia model, cultures were maintained with normalculture medium for 24 h. Then, medium was replaced by normalmedium (for control conditions) or TLR4 antagonists-containingmedium and for the following 6 days. The viability of motoneu-rons was assessed by counting the SMI32-positive cells (see belowfor immunostaining) with typical morphology and large cell bod-ies (>20  m) in the different treatment conditions. The number ofviable motoneurons was normalized to the mean of SMI32-positivecells counted in the appropriate control wells (untreated cultures for tests in wild type cocultures; cocultures with NTg derived gliafor studies on SOD1mut glia effects). In a typical experiment withcocultures, the number of counted SMI32-positive cells in controlwells was 70 \u00b1 11 (n = 12; not shown).",

The survival was defined as the loss of righting reflex (the age when the animal could not right itself within 30 s when placed on its side). Measurements of body weight and the loss of hind limb reflex were used to score the clinical onset of disease in SOD1G93A mice, as previously described [30]. The SOD1G93A reflex score and body weight were measured every 2 days, beginning at 45 days. Scoring was performed in a blind manner by animal technicians who had no information about the genotype but had experience in grading SOD1G93A mice paralysis.",

Twenty minutes prior to the imaging session the mice received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of D-luciferine, a luciferase substrate (150 mg/kg; Xenogen) dissolved in 0.9 % saline. The mice were then anesthetized with 2%isoflurane in 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 2 L/min and placed in the heated, light-tight imaging chamber. Images of lumbar spinal cord region of interest were collected using high sensitivity charge-coupled device camera with wavelengths ranging from 300 to 600 nm. Exposition time for imaging was 1 min using different fields of view and a F/1 lens aperture. The bioluminescence emission was normalized and displayed in physical units of surface radiance, photons/s/cm2/steradian [31, 32]. The light output was quantified by determining the total number of photons emitted per second using Living Image 4.1 acquisition and imaging software (PerkinElmer,Waltham, MA, USA). Region-of-interest measurements on the images were used to convert surface radiance (photons/s/cm2/ steradian) to source flux or total flux of photons expressed in photons/s.",

        "text": "Gastrocnemius Re-innervation. As large numbers ofNMJs can be quantified from fewer mice, we selected a smaller subset of animals from our electrophysiology studies for gastrocnemius quantification. Following 2% paraformaldehyde overnight fixation and storage in 1X PBS, the gastrocnemius muscle was dissected out and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1 \u00d7 PBS overnight. The gastrocnemius muscles were then frozen onto a microtome stage before cutting 50-\u03bcm-thick sections (Microm MH450, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tissue sections were permeabilized and blocked by 5% goat serum (Jackson laboratories)/0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 \u00d7 PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were then stained overnight at 4 \u00b0C with primary antibodies against neurofilament (NF) and SV2 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, Iowa) to visualize the axons. \u03b1-bungarotoxin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (\u03b1-BTX, Life Technologies) and the corresponding Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) were stained for 1 h at room temperature before being mounted in prolong diamond mounting reagent (Life Technologies) and cover-slipped. The sections were then imaged using a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope. NMJs were scored as being innervated by having at least half of the YFP presynaptic expression overlapping with the postsynaptic \u03b1-BTX staining.",

These were done by assessing the toxicity of the drug on three plates of 60 embryos at various doses and represented as percent survival. Optimal doses were then added at gastrulation (final concentration of 1% DMSO), and exposure continued for the duration of the assay. 5 mM mbryonic surviva was added as the oxidative stressor at 24 hpf and survival was measured at 48 hpf.",

Sections were washed four times with PBST with 0.2% Tween 20 for 15 minutes each and washed twice with 0.01 M PB (pH 7.4) for 15 minutes. Sections were incubated in Vectastain RTU reagent (Vector Labs) for 90 minutes and were washed four times with 0.01 M PB (pH 7.4) for 15 minutes each. The reaction product was visualized with 0.025% 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 0.0033% H2O2 in 0.01 M PB (pH 7.4) or 0.2 M Tris (pH 7.6). The course of the reaction was monitored and stopped by washing in PBST. Sections were serially dehydrated for 10 minutes each in 70% and 100% EtOH, cleared in xylene for 15 minutes, and mounted with Permount (Fisher Scientific). Sections from the dorsal fin region were blinded to genotype and each section was counted for ChATpositive motor neurons with an area greater than 200 \u03bcm2. A minimum of 40 serial sections were counted from three fish for each genotype (Ramesh et al., 2010).",

        "text": "Adult movement analysis. Locomotor activity was assessed using the ZebraLab system (ViewPoint, Lyon, France) (Tierney, 2011). T70I homozygous mutants and WT animals were imaged ten at a time in a tank and filmed simultaneously. An opaque screen separated the two tanks so that the fish from the two tanks did not influence each other\u2019s behaviour. The fish were allowed to acclimatize in the tank for 15 minutes and then the activity was recorded continuously for 15 minutes. The same animals were analysed again after 7 days and three independent observations from these fish were recorded. The system consists of a digital camera connected to a computer with the ZebraLab software (ViewPoint, Lyon, France), which was able to process the global activity and the average centre of mass of a group of fish in a tank. To improve detection, a ZebraSquare illumination device (ViewPoint, Lyon, France) was used. This consists of an infrared lighting unit that increases contrast between the fish in the tank and the background, especially in totally dark conditions. The images were digitized with an 800\u00d7600 pixels definition. Each pixel is coded on 256 grey levels. The images were processed in real time at 25 frames per second. Global activity was classified into three different categories based on user-defined thresholds. The classification is made between inactivity, normal activity and hyperactivity. The centre of mass of the group of fish in relation to the depth of the tank was assigned into equal horizontal thirds (top, middle and bottom).",

Mouse wild-type (Hb9-GFP) and mutant (SOD1G93A/Hb9-GFP) ES cell colonies were dissociated and cultured in 45% DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies), 45% Neurobasal (Life Technologies), 10% KnockOut Serum Replacement (Life Technologies) with 2mML-glutamine (Life Technologies), 55 mM b-mercaptoethanol (Life Technologies), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies). After 2 days, embryoid bodies were treated with retinoic acid (RA; 100 nM) and a hedgehog agonist (SAG; 100 nM). On day 3, embryoid bodies were treated with RA (100 nM) and SAG (1 mM) and incubated for 72 h. Papain (Worthington Biochemical) and DNase I (Worthington Biochemical) were used to dissociate embryoid bodies. Cells were plated on polyornithine- coated 96-well plates, 12-well plates or 6- well plates and cultured in DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies), 2% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies), 10 mg/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), progesterone, BSA, selenite and apotransferrin (Sigma- Aldrich) supplemented with B27 (Life Technologies), 20 ng/ml GDNF (R&D Systems), 20 ng/ml BDNF (R&D Systems) and 20 ng/ml CNTF (R&D Systems) (Makhortova et al., 2011). MNs were seeded at a density of 3 3 104 GFP+ cells per 100 mL medium (96-well plate). An antimitotic agent Ara-C was added into the culture medium from day 2 to eliminate progenitors. TFs were removed 4 days after plating, at which time, siRNAs or small molecules were added. After an additional 3 days, cells were scanned using a high-content live-imaging microscope (PerkinElmer Operetta) at 10x magnification. For each well of 96-well plate, 9-12 evenly distributed fields were imaged, covering more than 50% of the well. The number of surviving MNs was measured by counting GFP+ cells with healthy neurites using Columbus Image Analysis software (Perkin Elmer). For long-term studies, MNs were fed with fresh medium and re-treated with siRNA or chemicals every 3-4 days. The number of healthy MNs was quantified at different time points as needed.",

Human wild-type ESCs (H9/Islet-RFP), wild-type iPSCs (BJsiPSC) and iPSCs from ALS patients (SOD1L144F, TDP43G298S, and TDP43M337V) were differentiated as embryoid bodies in DMEM/F12 containing 1% N2 and 2% B27. The embryoid bodies were treated with 1 mM Dorsomorphin (Stemgent) and 10 mM SB431542 (Stemgent) for 4 days, with addition of 1 mM retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mM smoothened agonist (EMD Millipore) after 5 more days. After, embyroid body formation, colonies were then plated on poly-ornithine and laminin-coated plates to differentiate neural progenitors to MNs. After an additional 14-20 days of differentiation, the cultures were dissociated to single cells with Papain (Worthington Biochemical) and DNase I (Worthington Biochemical). MNs were seeded on astrocyte-coated plates at a density of 3-5 3 105 cells per ml in neurobasal containing 1% N2, 2% B27, 20% D-Glucose, 200 mg/ml Ascorbic acid with 20 ng/ml GDNF, 20 ng/ml BDNF and 20 ng/ml CNTF (Ding et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013). TFs (BDNF,GDNF,CNTF) along with B27 were removed after 4 days culture, and siRNAs or small molecules were added. The MNs were fed with fresh medium and re-treated with chemicals or siRNAs every 4 days. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde after a further 12 to 16 days in culture. MN survival was measured by counting Isl-RFP+ cells (H9/Isl-RFP) and Isl+/Tuj1+ cells (hiPSCs). Ara-C was used through the entire experiment. For the thapsigargin and tunicamycin MN survival assays, 1 mM of each compound (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to human MN cultures without astrocytes 3 days after dissociation. MAP4K4 inhibitor was added at the same time as the stressors. Cells were kept in culture for an additional 48 hours and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. MN survival counted as in TF survival assay, number of Isl+/Tuj1+ cells. For astrocyte co-culture, mouse glial cells were dissected from P0-P2 mouse cortices as previously described (Schildge et al., 2013). At least 2 days before MN dissociation, 5,000 glial cells per well were pre-seeded into 96-well plates. Glial cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technolgies) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (EMD Millipore).",

        "text": "CPT1A antagonist studies.  A pilot study was conducted using female SOD1 (n = 10) and wildtype (n = 4) littermates. SOD1 mice were randomized into treatment with the irreversible CPT1A antagonist, etomoxir (5 mg/kg) (n = 7), or placebo (olive oil) (n = 3) from day 100. Treatment was administered one a daily basis by oral gavage. Mice were evaluated weekly by neurological score, weight, and hangwire test as described under clinical behavior test. Following the pilot study, a larger study was setup. Female SOD1 (n = 18) and wildtype (n = 9) littermates were randomized into treatment with etomoxir or placebo from day 70. Mice were evaluated weekly by neurological score, grip strength, hangwire test, rotarod test, and at day 70, day 100 and day 130 mice were evaluated by cylinder, and y-maze test. Moreover, fecal samples were collected at day 70 before treatment start (n = 5), and at day 130 for the two SOD1 treatment groups. Serum, brain, muscle, and spinal cord tissue was obtained when mice were euthanized between day 145\u2013150. Another CPT1A antagonist study was conducted from day 70 and until day 130 to obtain spinal cord tissue for immunohistochemistry. Female SOD1 (n = 11) and wildtype littermates (n = 4) were randomized into treatment with etomoxir or placebo and evaluated by neurological score and grip strength once a week, as described below. At day 130 mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and quickly perfused with 1xPBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and spinal cords were harvested for further analyzes.\"",

Mice were given a neurological score between zero to five as previously described30,31. Zero = no tremor in hindlimbs and full extension of hindlimbs when suspended by its tail. One = tremor in hindlimbs and full extension of hindlimbs when suspended by its tail. Two = tremor in hindlimbs and unable to extend hindlimbs when suspended by its tail. Three = tremor in hindlimbs, unable to extend hindlimbs when suspended by its tail and wobbling gait. Four = tremor in hindlimbs, unable to extend hindlimbs when suspended by its tail difficulty walking with paralysis of one of both hindlimbs. Five = tremor in hindlimbs, unable to extend hindlimbs and unable to get up within 30 s when placed on its side. Onset of disease was defined as the time point when tremor in the hind legs was present as previously described30. Owing to ethical reasons and based on the guidelines in the Animal Facility, mice were terminated if they reached a neurological score of four or latest at day 160. Based on this, survival was defined as a neurological score below 4 at the final day of experimentation. Owing to the fact that mice had to be terminated at day 160, some mice did not reach a neurological score of 4 and, therefore, some of the groups have censored data in the survival analysis.",

In order to determine the equilibration dissociation constant (KD) of hSOD1 to the selected peptide, microscale thermophoresis (MST) measurements were performed using a Monolith NT.115 blue/red instrument (Nanotemper Technologies, Munich, Germany). Fluorescently labeled hSOD1 (CF633-hSOD1; DOL of 0.5) with a final dimeric concentration of 250 nM was added to samples containing increasing concentrations of unlabeled peptide. Therefore, a 1:1 serial dilution of peptide and a 500 nM CF33-hSOD1 stock solution were prepared in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 6 containing 150 mM sodium chloride and 0.05% Tween-20. The 16 samples were then transferred into specialized glass capillaries (Monolith NT.155 premium capillaries MO-K025; Nanotemper Technologies, Munich, Germany). The measurement was performed at 25 \u00b0C using the blue/ red channel with an MST and LED power of 40% leading to fluorescence levels between 700 and 900 units. For all experiments, standard parameters were used as recommend by the manufacturer (delay time of heating period of 30 s and re-equilibration period of 5 s). The data were evaluated through the thermophoresis effect using the manufacturer supplied NT analysis software (version 1.5.41).",

A cell viability assay using the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was performed to investigate the cytotoxicity of hSOD1 species that were previously incubated with and without S1VL-21 under aggregating conditions. Therefore, Neuro2a cells were cultivated in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. A total of 2500 cells per well in a volume of 100 \u03bcL were seeded on flat-bottomed 96-well plates (VWR, Radnor, USA) and incubated in a 95% humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C for 6 h.

The samples were collected after 65 h and centrifuged for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C and 100 000g. The supernatant was completely removed, whereas the pellet was dissolved in the same volume of cell culture medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin) and diluted to 1:1. Neuro2a cells were then treated with 30 \u03bcL of each sample and were further incubated for 3 days in a 95% humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. Cell viability was measured using the Cell Proliferation Kit I according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) in a 5-fold determination. The absorbance of the formazan product was determined by measuring the absorption at 570 nm subtracted by the absorbance at 690 nm in a microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). The results were normalized to the mean value of cells treated with medium only. As a positive control for cytotoxicity, 10% DMSO diluted in medium was used.",

Transgenic SOD1G93A mice expressing mutant human SOD1 with a Gly93Ala substitution (B6SJL-Tg-SOD1G93A-1Gur) were originally obtained from Jackson Laboratories (No. 002726). The genotypes of the transgenic mice were identified by PCR as in our previous reports [8]. Verapamil (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in ddH2O to a final concentration of 0.125mg/\u03bcL and further diluted with ddH2O before intraperitoneal injection. As there is gender differences in terms of disease progression and lifespan in SOD1G93A mice [24], we used only male mice to avoid gender diversity. To assess the effect of verapamil on disease onset and survival, 24 male SOD1G93A mice were randomly divided into 2 groups: (1) Tg-Vera group, intraperitoneally injected with verapamil at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight/day (n = 12); (2) Tg-Con group, used as control, intraperitoneally injected with the same volume of ddH2O (n = 12). The injection was given once a day starting from 64 days after birth until the day of death. No significant side effects under this dosage were observed in our experiment. To explore the mechanisms of neuroprotective effects provided by verapamil, 24 SOD1G93A mice and 24 age- and sex-matched wild-type (WT) littermates were randomly divided into four groups: verapamil treatment at the dose of 25mg/kg body weight/day in SOD1G93A mice (Tg-Vera, n = 12) or WT mice (WT-Vera, n = 12), and ddH2O treatment in SOD1G93A mice (Tg-Con, n = 12) or WT mice (WT-Con, n = 12). These mice were sacrificed at the age of 120 days for Western blotting and skeletal muscle analysis, immunofluorescent staining, electron microscopy analysis and calpain activity assay. All animals were housed at 21 ~ 24\u2103 and controlled 12-hour light/dark cycle. Animal use was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and all procedures in our experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of NIH for animal care.",

Rotarod performance was tested two times a week on a rotarod apparatus (Ugo Basile 7650 model) at a constant speed of 15 rpm over a maximum of 180-s period, starting at 8 weeks of age until animals were unable to remain on the rotarod. After a training period of 3 days, the latency to fall off was recorded as a measure of the competence to motor function. During each day test, the animals had three trials and the best performance was recorded and included in the data analysis [24].",

        "text": "Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy. Mice were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (500 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde at pH 7.4. Tissue samples were then postfixed overnight in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS and then cryoprotected in 30 % sucrose in PBS at 4 \u00b0C. Tissues were then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Spinal cords (L3-L5) were cut at 30 \u03bcm of thickness with a frozen microtome. The double immunofluorescence analysis was performed according to the following procedure. A rectangle was drawn around the sections with a PAP pen (Sigma-Aldrich). After 1 to 2 h of air-drying, sections were blocked in PBS containing 10%normal donkey serum and 0.3 % Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Spinal cord sections were incubated with either mouse glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP (1:10, AbD Serotech, Oxford, UK), rabbit polyclonal anti-Iba1 (1:200, Wako, Richmond, VA), monoclonal rat anti-CD68 (1:100, AbD Serotech), or mouse monoclonal anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN) (1:200, Millipore,MA, USA) in PBS supplemented with 0.3%Triton X-100 and 2 % normal donkey serum, for 24 h at 4 \u00b0C. Slides were washed with PBS and incubated with appropriate fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies for 3 h at room temperature. The secondary antibodies used were Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch, PA, USA; red immunofluorescence), Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:100, Alexa, Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR, USA; green immunofluorescence), or Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch; red immunofluorescence). PBS washes (3\u00d75 min) were performed, and slides were coverslipped with Fluoromount medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Immunofluorescence was analyzed by means of a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, LSM700, Germany) equipped with four laser lines: 405, 488, 561, and 639 nm and using always identical acquisition parameters (laser intensity, photomultiplier gain, pinhole aperture, electronic zoom) for all the images. The brightness and contrast of the digital images were adjusted using the Zen software. Quantification of GFAP, Iba1, and CD68 immunoreactivities was performed on lumbar spinal cord sections (an average of six sections for each animal in each group were analyzed), using the ImageJ software (version 1.47, National Institutes of Health, USA), after background subtraction. Data are expressed as arbitrary units with respect to wild-type mice. SOD1G93A primary microglia were fixed for 20 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde, permeabilized for 5 min in PBS containing 0.1 % Triton X-100. The cells were then incubated for 1.5 h at 37 \u00b0C with rabbit Iba1 (1:200,Wako) in 1%BSA in PBS. The cultures were stained for 1 h with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Jackson Immunoresearch). Nuclei were stained with 1 \u03bcg/ml H\u00f6echst 33258 for 5 min, and the cells were finally mounted and coverslipped with gel/mount anti-fading (Biomeda, CA, USA). Immunofluorescence was analyzed using a confocal microscope as described above.\n\nClemastine failed to prevent astrogliosis (GFAP), as well as the increase in Iba1 staining, but remarkably reduced CD68 immunoreactivity, as shown by immunofluorescence and quantitative confocal analysis.",

The effects of the CTEP treatment on disease symptoms were analysed in behavioural tests, three times per week starting at Day 80 of life (10 days before starting the treatment), until killing. Sample sizes and animal numbers were predetermined according to the guidelines for the preclinical in vivo evaluation of pharmacological treatments for ALS/MND (Ludolph et al., 2007). We dedicated four newborn litters for behavioural tasks. The experiments were littermate controlled; the mouse was the experimental unit. The pharmacological treatments were randomized within the cage. The same procedure was applied to histology, pharmacokinetics and release experiments. We start a first trial with 15 male + 15 female CTEP-treated (2 mg kg 1 every 48 h) and 15 male + 14 female vehicle-treated mice. Three female vehicle-treated mice were not included in the trial (accidental death before Day 100 of life); thus, we concluded the first trial with n = 30 SOD1G93A mice (15 males and 15 females) treated with CTEP at the dose of 2 mg kg 1 every 48 h and with n = 26 SOD1G93A mice (15 males and 11 females) treated with vehicle.

        "text": "2.5 Synaptosome preparation and glutamate release experiments. The animals used in these experiments were not enrolled in behavioural tasks. SOD1G93A mice were treated with CTEP (4 mg kg 1 every 24 h, n = 6; three males and three females) or vehicle (n = 6; three males and three females) for 15 days, starting at Day 90 of life, by oral gavage. WT (n = 6; three males and three females), CTEP- and vehicle-treated SOD1G93A mice were killed as described above and the spinal cord was rapidly dissected at 4 C. Spinal cord synaptosomes were prepared essentially as previously described (Raiteri et al., 2007). The tissue was homogenized in 14 vol. of 0.32-M sucrose (VWR, PA, USA, Cat# 0335) buffered at pH 7.4 with Tris\u2013HCl, using a glass-Teflon tissue grinder (clearance 0.25 mm; Cat# 432-0208, Cat# 432-0202). The homogenate was centrifuged (5 min, 1000  g at 4 C) to remove nuclei and debris, and the supernatant was gently stratified on a discontinuous Percoll\u00ae (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; Cat# P1644) gradient (2%, 6%, 10% and 20% v/v in Tris-buffered sucrose). After centrifugation at 33,500  g for 5 min, the layer between 10% and 20% Percoll (synaptosomal fraction) was collected and washed in physiological medium having the following compositions: NaCl, 140 mM; KCl, 3 mM (VWR, PA, USA, Cat# 26764.260); MgSO4, 1.2 mM (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, Cat# 1.05886.1000); NaH2PO4, 1.2 mM (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, Cat# 1.06346.0500); NaHCO3, 5 mM (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, Cat# 1.06329.1000); CaCl2, 1.2 mM (VWR, PA, USA, Cat# A0222282); HEPES, 10 mM (VWR, PA, USA, Cat# 0511); and glucose, 10 mM (VWR, PA, USA, Cat# 0188) (pH 7.4), centrifuged (20,000  g for 15 min at 4 C) and resuspended in physiological medium for release experiments. Synaptosomes purified from WT, CTEP- and vehicle-treated SOD1G93A mice were incubated at 37 C for 15 min in the presence of 0.05-\u03bcM [3H]D-Aspartate ([3H]D-Asp), a nonmetabolizable analogue of glutamate used to label the synaptosomal glutamate releasing pools (Fleck et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2007). Aliquots of the synaptosomal suspensions (5- to 10-\u03bcg protein) were distributed on microporous filters of nitrocellulose (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, Cat# DAWP02500) placed at the bottom of a set of parallel superfusion chambers maintained at 37 C (Superfusion System, Ugo Basile, Comerio, VA, Italy; Bonanno & Raiteri, 1987). Superfusion was then started with standard medium at a rate of 0.5 ml min 1. After 36 min of superfusion to equilibrate the system, four 3-min fractions were collected (t = 36\u201339; 39\u201342; 42\u201345; and 45\u201348 min). 3,5-DHPG (0.3 or 30 \u03bcM) was introduced at the end of the first sample collected (t = 39 min) and maintained until the end of the experiment. In the case of KCl depolarization, samples were collected according to the following scheme: two 3-min samples (t = 36\u201339 and 45\u201348 min; basal release) before and after one 6-min sample (t = 39\u201345 min; stimulusevoked release). Stimulation with a 90-s pulse of 15-mM KCl was applied at t = 39 min. Collected samples and superfused synaptosomes at the end of the experiment were counted for radioactivity by a beta-counter system (TRI-CARB 4810TR Liquid Scintillation Analyser; PerkinElmer Holdings Ltd., UK; Cat# A481001). Tritium released in each sample was calculated as fractional rate   100 (percentage of the total synaptosomal neurotransmitter content at the beginning of the respective collection period). 3,5-DHPG effects were evaluated by calculating the ratio between the efflux in the fourth sample collected (in which the maximum effect of 3,5-DHPG was generally reached) and the efflux in the first sample (spontaneous release). This ratio was compared with the corresponding ratio obtained under control condition (in the absence of 3,5-DHPG). The KCl-evoked [3H]D-Asp overflow was estimated by subtracting the transmitter content of the two 3-min samples representing the spontaneous release from the transmitter content in the 6-min fraction collected during and after the stimulating pulse.",

        "text": "2.6 LC\u2013MS analysis of CTEP. WT or SOD1G93A mice were chronically treated with CTEP (4 mg kg 1 every 24 h; n = 10 per group; five males and five females) for 15 days, by gavage. Animals used in these experiments were not enrolled in behavioural tasks. Tissue extracts were prepared by homogenization in ice of the brain or liver in 0.9% NaCl (20% p/v). Samples were added of an equal volume of acetonitrile, vortexed and incubated at 22 C for 60 min. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 7000  g for 10 min, and supernatants were collected. In the case of plasma, obtained by anticoagulation of blood samples with EDTA, 100-\u03bcl sample was added with 100-\u03bcl acetonitrile and then processed as above. CTEP serial dilutions in DMSO and acetonitrile, and tissue brain, liver and plasma from untreated mice were used for calibration curves. CTEP content was determined by HPLC using a Vanquish (Thermo Fisher Scientific) UHPLC system composed of binary pump, auto-sampler and column oven. Samples (5 \u03bcl) were injected onto a Symmetry 300\u2122 C18 column (150   1 mm, 3.5-\u03bcm particle size) maintained at 40 C (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA; http://www. waters.com). The eluents were 0.1% formic acid in water (Eluent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (Eluent B). Flow rate was 100 \u03bcl min 1, and the elution was 5-min isocratic 20% B, 15-min linear gradient to 60% B, 3-min linear gradient to 100% B, 12-min isocratic 100% B and 1-min linear gradient to 20% B. The reequilibration time in 20% B was 14 min. After HPLC separation, the eluent was analysed by Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, USA) equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source (HESI-II). Before each acquisition series, the mass spectrometer was calibrated with the positive ion calibration solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were analysed by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mode under positive polarity condition. Instrument and collision cell (HCD) parameters were optimized by syringe direct infusion of CTEP in acetonitrile. Sheath and auxiliary gas flow rate were 33 and 10, respectively; spray voltage was 4.0 kV; capillary temperature was 250 C; S-lens RF level was 100; and auxiliary gas heater temperature was 180 C. Software used for operating the UHPLC/HR-MS was Xcalibur (Version 4.1; RRID:SCR_014593). The PRM mode analysis was conducted at 17,500 resolution. The autogain control (AGC) was optimized at 2 x 105 with a maximum injection time (maxIT) of 250 ms, and the normalized collision energy (NCE) for fragmentation of CTEP was optimized at 95. Quantitation of CTEP in PRM mode was based on fragmentation of precursor ion 392 m/z (CTEP) to 128.05 m/z production. CTEP final concentration was then expressed as \u03bcg g 1 brain tissue or \u03bcg ml 1 plasma.",

The acquired fresh spinal cords at the age of 120 days were lysed with radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Beyotime, P0013B) containing 1% protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Beyotime, ST506). The lysates were centrifuged at 13 000 g for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C with an high-speed centrifuge (Beckman coulter, Brea, CA, USA) to obtain the supernatant fluid. The proteins were quantitated with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23225, Waltham, MA, USA). Forty-microgram proteins were loaded in 8% or 12% SDS gel and then transferred to 0.22 or 0.45 \u03bcm polyvinylidenefloride membranes as required.

After PBS perfusion, at the age of 120 days, the fresh gastrocnemius muscles (5\u00d75\u00d710 mm3) were dissected and immersed immediately in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen and embedded with bassora gum. The muscle tissues were cross-sectioned at 10 \u03bcm thickness; then, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NADH) staining was performed. Both the area of gastrocnemius muscle fibers and the percent of type I fiber were measured in 10 visual fields of each mouse (n=5 in each group). The dissected fresh gastrocnemius muscles were weighed, and 0.9% normal saline was added at a ratio of 1:9 (w/v). The muscles homogenate was prepared with ultrasonic homogenizer and then centrifuged at 1000 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The neuronal pathology (MDA) level was determined with commercial kit (Jiancheng, A003-2, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction.

        "text": "2.3 Animal gait analysis. CatWalk XT system Version 10.6 was used according to the manufacturer (Noldus Information Technology, Netherlands) instructions with the Intensity of the Green Walkway Light 16,5 V; Camera Gain 20 dB; Green Intensity Threshold 0,1; and Red Ceiling Light 17,7 V. All animals had one habituation session to the CatWalk apparatus one day before the first test. Each animal was tested every or every second day until the onset of clinical signs. On the testing day, each animal was allowed to explore and walk freely through the apparatus detection \u201crunway\u201d without any rewards. During this test period of maximum 10 minutes, at least 3 videos of an uninterrupted crossing of the recording field of the runway (approximately 35 cm) were automatically recorded. Runs for analysis were selected based on a minimum of four step cycles in the crossing field, such that each step cycle involved capturing the use of each of the four paws irrespective of the order in which paws were used. After classification of the footprints in these runs using the CatWalk software, qualified data39\u201341 w ere e xported f or further analysis to the RStudio.42 Given that the disease progression has individual characteristics resulting in a floating date of the manifestation of clinical signs, we have compared changes in the gait of animals in the reverse direction starting from the day when first clinical signs were observed to the day of the beginning of data collection. In order to combine the data of gait analysis between the animals with different ages, time intervals were adjusted to 25 days for each animal starting from the day of the manifestation of clinical signs, as illustrated in Figure S1. Statistical analysis was done using nonparametric Wilcoxon test for each of CatWalk parameters of untreated and DF402-treated mice. The difference was considered significant if it was determined in at least one of the time intervals: 1\u201310 days, 11\u201318 days, and 19\u201325 days with p < 0.05 (Benjamini-Hochberg correction). Representative analysis of significantly changed group of variables was performed by calculating the frequency of components implemented in the intrinsic structure of CatWalk parameters. For example, parameter \u201cRight_Hind_MaxIntensity\u201d consists of two components \u201cRight_hind\u201d and \u201cMaxIntensity\u201d representing qualitative and quantitative indicators. The frequency was determined as a ratio of the significantly changed parameters or components included in such parameter (p < 0.05; Benjamini-Hochberg correction) to all CatWalk parameters. For principal component analysis, the values of all parameters were transformed to z-scores ((x-mean( x)/sd(x)).

Following blocking in 5% fat-free milk in 1\u00d7 TBST, the following primary antibodies were used for different experiments at 4\u00b0C overnight: rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen) at 1:3000, rabbit anti-FUS (Abcam) at 1:1000, and mouse anti-tubulin \u03b2 clone KMX-1 (Millipore) at 1:1000. Secondary antibodies used were as follows: goat anti-rabbit at 1:10 000 or goat anti-mouse at 1:10 000. Proteins were detected using Odyssey and quantified using LICOR Image Studio Lite software. TDP43 and FUS levels were normalized to \u03b2-tubulin and represented as fold change. The data are an average of three independent experiments. Error bars indicate SEM.\n\nThe neuroprotective effect of pioglitazone was not due to a reduction in TDP-43 protein levels as determined by western blot.",

CRC assays were performed on freshly isolated mitochondria from adult non-tg mouse brain and heart (n = 6) after GNX-4728 was administered intravenousy by tail vein injection (15mg/kg in 20% DMSO and 40% PEG 400) followed by a survival of 5min. Control mice (n=6) were injected with vehicle. Brain and heart mitochondria were isolated using a similar procedure as described (Wongetal., 2013). Mitochondrial CRC was assessed fluorimetrically in the presence of the fluorescent Ca2C indicator Calcium Green 5N(Invitrogen Molecular Probes)using a temperature controlled Perkin-Elmer LS 55 spectrofluorimeter as described  (Fancellietal., 2014). Briefly, purified organ mitochondria were pulse-loaded with 10mM calciumand then challenged with increasing concentrations of calcium until mitochondrial permeability transition was triggered as evidenced by complete release of mitochondrially-stored calcium due to mPTP opening.",

        "text": "Tg mice and drug treatment protocol. Cohorts of tg mice expressing mutated G37R-hSOD1 were bred and identified by genotyping of tail DNA as described (Martin et al., 2007, 2009; Wong and Martin, 2010). All mice were housed in the institutional vivarium with generally 4\u20135 mice per cage and ad libitum food and water. Starting at 6 months of age, before the onset of overt symptoms, male G37R-hSOD1 mice were treated with 300 \u00b5g (100 \u00b5l) of GNX-4728 or vehicle (DMSO/cyclodextrin/saline) every other day by intraperitoneal injection. Only male mice were used because of known gender-differences in the involvement of the mPTP regulator cyclophilin D in ALS pathobiology (Martin et al., 2009) and to minimize burden to the operators treating mice over long-term with individual injections. This dosage and treatment regimen was in part based on preliminary data showing GNX-4728 protection of ALS mouse spinal cord mitochondria from Ca2+-induced swelling (Martin et al., unpublished observations). The treatment group size totals were 18\u201320 mice, but these mice were divided among different experiments, including survival studies. The initial randomization was accomplished using the envelope method with knowledge of litter origin so that individuals from the same litter could be distributed across groups. Mice were maintained in the colony and received vehicle or GNX-4728 treatment. For survival experiments, the vehicle and GNX-4728 group sizes were 10 and 12, respectively. The mice were observed once a day. The disease progresses usually from hindleg paraplegia with some function of the forelimbs remaining. When animals developed paraplegia, ad libitum nutrigel and chow were placed in the cage, and water was available at a bottom-cage level drinking spout. At this time locomotor activity is compromised but the animals can still ambulate to access food and water. At this stage, the mice are observed three or more times a day. Endstage disease was defined as complete lack of locomotor activity, detected within 2\u20134 h after onset, at which time the mice were euthanized. A subgroup of mice was killed before endstage to assess the efficacy of GNX-4728 using histological endpoints. Disease onset was assessed by running wheel activity and hind-limb paresis. Vehicle and GNX-4728 treated mice and age-matched non-tg littermate mice were evaluated for neurologic deficit. They were assessed at 12 months of age using a voluntary activity wheel (Harvard Apparatus).",

        "text": "Spinal cord and neuromuscular pathology. Vehicle and GNX-4728 treated tg mice and na\u00efve mice (n = 5 per group) at 12 months of age were deeply anesthetized and perfused by cardiac puncture with ice-cold 100 mM phosphate-buffered normal saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After perfusion-fixation, mouse bodies were stored at 4\u00b0C overnight and then the spinal cord and diaphragm were removed from each mouse. Spinal cords were cryoprotected (20% glycerol) before they were frozen-sectioned (40 \u00b5m) transversely using a sliding microtome. Serial tissue section arrays were stored individually in 96-well plates in anti-freeze buffer. The diaphragm was removed as a complete tissue sheet (Comerford and Fitzgerald, 1986) and placed in PBS at 4\u00b0C until processed for NMJ visualization.Nissl-stained transverse sections of spinal cord were used to count the number of motor neurons in vehicle and GNX-4728 treated tg mice and in age-matched littermate non-tg mice. Spinal cord sections were selected with a random start and then systematically sampled (every 10th section) to generate a subsample of sections from each mouse lumbar spinal cord that was mounted on glass slides and stained with cresyl violet for cell counting. Nissl-stained motor neurons in ventral horn were counted by individuals blinded to experimental treatment, using strict morphological criteria, in digital images acquired with a Nikon microscope at 200x magnification. These criteria included a round, open, pale nucleus (not condensed and darkly stained), globular Nissl staining of the cytoplasm, and a diameter of ~20\u201340 \u00b5m. With these criteria, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia were excluded from the counts, but these counts are likely to estimate the combined populations of \u03b1- and \u03b3-motor neurons.Mitochondrial pathology was assessed specifically within spinal cord motor neurons using immunohistochemistry. Free-floating spinal cord sections from GNX-4728- and vehicle-treated G37R-hSOD1 tg mice and age-matched non-tg mice were stained by an immunoperoxidase method with antibodies to the mitochondrial matrix marker superoxide dismutase-2 (Stressgen) and diaminobenzidine as described (Martin et al., 2007). Mitochondrial diameters within motor neurons were measured by individuals blinded to experimental history using ocular filar micrometry as described (Martin et al., 2007).Diaphragm motor endplates were visualized with Alexa 594-conjugated \u03b1-bungarotoxin (BTX, Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) as described (Martin and Liu, 2007). Dual labeling was done to visualize motor neuron distal axons and their terminals in whole diaphragm preparations by immunofluorescent detection of neurofilament protein using a monoclonal antibody (SMI-32, Convance) and confocal microscopy as described (Martin and Liu, 2007). The immunofluorescent labeling for neurofilament was used to determine whether the BTX-labeled motor endplates were innervated. Confocal microscope images of the typical band distributions of motor endplates in diaphragm (Comerford and Fitzgerald, 1986) were scored as innervated (normal) if there was overlap with the axon terminal or denervated (unoccupied) if the endplate was not associated with an axon. NMJ imaging and scoring were performed by individuals unaware of mouse treatment.",

        "text": "Light and Confocal Microscopy. After deep anesthesia with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) mice were perfused with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min. The lumbosacral enlargement of the spinal cord (L2-S1) was dissected and post-fixed for 2 h. Spinal cord fragments were either dehydrated and embedded in diethylene glycol or processed for mechanical dissociation of MNs as previously reported (Pena et al., 2001). For neuronal dissociation, small tissue fragments from the anterior horn were transferred to a drop of PBS on a siliconized slide. Then, a coverslip was applied on top of the slide and the tissue was squashed by percussion with a histologic needle in order to dissociate neuronal cell bodies. The preparation was then frozen in dry ice, and the coverslip removed using a razor blade. Using this procedure, most MNs remained adhered to the slide. Cell samples were processed in 96% ethanol at 4\u00b0C for 10 min, which increases the adhesion of cells to the slide, and rehydrated progressively in 70% ethanol and PBS. These squash preparations were used for propidium iodide (PI), a fluorescent staining of nucleic acids, and immunofluorescence.

The early loss of MN was evaluated at day 75 and 95 of life. The number of MNs was counted in four sections of each animal at segment L4 using hematoxylin\u2013eosin staining. Only polygonal-shaped neurons present in ventral horns, larger than 20 \u03bcm and with prominent nucleoli, were used for the quantitative analysis as previously reported (Mancuso et al., 2014). For immunofluorescence, tissue sections and squash preparations were sequentially treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, 0.1M glycine in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. Then, the sections were incubated with the specific secondary antibody conjugated with FITC or Cy3 and mounted with Vectashield (Vector, USA). Confocal images were obtained with a LSM510 (Zeiss, Germany) laser scanning microscope using 40\u00d7 oil or 63\u00d7 oil (1.4 NA) objectives. In order to avoid overlapping signals, images were obtained by sequential excitation at 488 and 543 nm, to detect FITC and Cy3, respectively. Images were processed using Photoshop software. To quantify astrogliosis, confocal images of the ventral horn\u2019s gray matter immunostained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were recorded by using a 40\u00d7 oil objective and the same confocal settings. Images were background corrected by reference regions outside the tissue and fluorescence intensities were estimated by using the ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The relative nuclear levels of RXR\u03b1 in MNs of wild type, Bxt-treated and vehicle-treated transgenic SOD1G93A mice were determined on 5 \u03bcm thick cryostat sections immunostained with the anti-RXR\u03b1 antibody. Only anterior horn neurons larger than 20 \u03bcm and with prominent nucleoli were sampled. We used three animals per experimental group and at least 35 neurons per animal were sampled. Confocal images were recorded by using a 63\u00d7 oil objective (NA 1.4) and the same confocal settings at a resolution of 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixels. The same immunostaining and image processing procedures were carried out for all the experimental groups.

        "text": "Western Blotting and Real Time Quantitative PCR. Ten transgenic mice, treated with Bxt or vehicle from day 60 until day 95 of life, were used in these studies. For each biochemical assay (rtqPCR or WB) at least three mice of each animal group were used. Age-matched wild type mice receiving vehicle were used for comparison. After being anesthetized, they were decapitated and the lumbar spinal cord quickly removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Gene expression was assessed by rtqPCR. RNA from spinal cord samples was isolated with Trizol following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad) and purified with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as previously reported (Delgado- Calle et al., 2011). Aliquots of RNA were reverse-transcribed with the PrimeScrip RT kit (Takara) using random hexamers as primers. Then, the expression of cathepsin D was determined rtqPCR using gene-specific primers and TaqMan probes (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA). The threshold cycle (Ct) for each well was determined. The results were normalized to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1). Relative gene expression was calculated as 2\u2212\u039bCT, where \u039bCT is the difference between the gene of interest threshold cycle and the HPRT1 threshold cycle. For WB analysis, the spinal cord samples (the ventral region of lumbosacral enlargement) were homogenized in a lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 \u03bcg/ ml aprotinin) and the homogenates were centrifuged. The protein in the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and afterwards transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, stained with antibodies, and visualized with the Odyssey system (LI-COR Biotechnology). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and tubulin were used as protein loading controls. The antibodies used were a goat polyclonal anti-cathepsin D (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Europe) and mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). ImageJ software (U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to quantify the density and size of the blots.\n\nWestern blot and real time rtqPCR analysis of cathepsin D.",

Assessment of each mouse began with observation of undisturbed behaviour in habitual environment followed by testing the motor abilities in an arena of 42.5 cm   18.0 cm   26.5 cm (L   H   W). Lastly, a sequence of manipulations were used to measure body tone and reflexes. Scoring was defined from 0 (similar to ntg littermates) to 3 (extremely abnormal from ntg littermates). The sum of scores of all subtests per animal was used for analysis. Especially for this mouse model, the last seven tests mentioned above are additionally summed up to a motor score.",

        "text": "5.12. Immunohistochemistry. The left-brain hemisphere and the lumbar spinal cord (L1-L5 tract) were cut for immunohistological analysis using a cryotome (Leica Biosystems Nussloch GmbH,Wetzlar, Germany). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 20  m sagittal frozen brain sections and on 12  m transverse lumbar spinal cord sections (L1-L5 tract). The brain and lumbar region of the spinal cord were identified as described previously [77\u201379]. To avoid differences in staining intensity, which might affect measurements, every staining session was performed in one batch. Gliosis of astrocytes and microglia (antibodies GFAP and CD11b) was assessed in SOD1G93A mice and their non-transgenic littermates. Furthermore, OD1G93A mice were investigated for mature neurons (antibody NeuN) and motor neurons (antibody ChAT) in the brain. Tissue sections were thawed and fixed with 4  C pre-cooled 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and followed by an antigen retrieval with 70% formicacid for 10 min. The sections were rinsed, and elimination of endogenous peroxidases was  ensured by incubation in 3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min. After a further washing step, sections were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4  C in a humid chamber (GFAP: DAKO Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA; NeuN: Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany; ChAT: Novus Biologicals Europe, Abingdon, United Kingdom) or for two hours at room temperature (CD11b: Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in tris buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100 (TBST) with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (GFAP and NeuN), 1:2000 in tris buffered saline (TBS) with 1% BSA (CD11b) or 1:1000 in phosphate bufferedsaline with 0.25% Triton X-100 (PBST) with 1% BSA (ChAT). Afterward, sections of SOD1G93A mice were rinsed and incubated with biotinylated secondary anti-mouse, anti-rabbit or anti-donkey antibody (1:1000 in TBST with 1% BSA (NeuN and GFAP), 1:1000 in TBS with 1% BSA (CD11b) or in PBST with 1% BSA (ChAT), Sigma Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) for two hours at room temperature followed by 3,30-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) enhanced with saturated nickel ammonium sulfate solution. Immunohistochemical sections were washed in an ascending alcohol series (in following order 70% EtOH, 90% EtOH and 100% EtOH for 5 min) and mounted with DPX Mountant medium (Sigma Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany).",

        "text": "2.2 Radioligand Binding Studies. To verify that JAK4D binds to TRH receptors in human CNS tissue, radioligand binding assays were undertaken. Confirmation that a compound binds to its targeted receptor in native human tissue is critical for progression to clinical development, especially since the apparent pharmacology of recombinant receptors may not reflect that of the native human target (George et al., 2002).[3H][3-Me-His2]TRH (NET 705, 57.4-62.0 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer, UK) was used to label TRH receptors in human hippocampal and pituitary tissue from individual non-identifiable donors aged 45-55 years with no history of neurological disease. These tissues were kindly donated to The University of Miami Brain Endowment Bank. Membranes from these tissues were prepared at the University of Miami and purchased from Tissue Solutions Limited, Scotland. Membranes were prepared essentially as described by (Hirst et al., 2000) except homogenization and resuspension buffers were the same as those we employed previously (Hogan et al., 2008; Kelly et al., 2005, 2002). Membranes were stored at -80 \u00b0C pending assay. Binding assays were conducted essentially as previously described (Hogan et al., 2008; Kelly et al., 2005, 2002). All assays were carried out at 4\u00b0C in 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 177 \u03bcM bacitracin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. In saturation binding experiments approximately 225 \u03bcg of membrane protein were incubated in triplicate with increasing concentrations of [3H][3-Me-His2]TRH (0.6 - 20 nM) for 5 h in a final volume of 100\u03bcl. Non-specific binding (NSB) was determined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM TRH. Competition experiments were conducted under similar conditions by incubating membrane suspensions in either duplicate (pituitary) or triplicate (hippocampus) with 10-12 nM [3H][3-Me- His2]TRH and increasing concentrations of competitor (10-10 to 10-3 M TRH or JAK4D). Competitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 10-2 M and diluted with assay buffer such that the final concentration of DMSO in all samples did not exceed 1%, a concentration at which specific binding of [3H][3-Me-His2]TRH is not affected (Kelly et al., 2002). Bound and free ligand were separated by vacuum filtration using a Brandel Cell Harvester and GF/B filters washed with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl solution. The radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting in a TRI-Carb 2100 TR Packard Liquid Scintillation Analyzer. Protein was measured by the method of Bradford.",

        "text": "2.4 Systemic K ainate (KA) Model.Neuroprotective effects of JAK4D were initially assessed in a rat model of kainate (KA)-induced neurodegeneration: systemic administration of the excitotoxic glutamate analog KA was used to produce deficits in learning and memory characteristic of human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and the ability of JAK4D to improve functional recovery from KA-induced learning deficits was evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM) test (D\u2019Hooge and De Deyn, 2001; Gobbo and O\u2019Mara, 2005). Male Wistar rats (approximately 250 g) (Comparative Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland) na\u00efve to drug treatment were used. Three independent experiments were undertaken by threedifferent investigators blinded to treatment. Rats were randomly assigned to five different groups. On Day 1 of the experiment, all animals received two i.p. injections. Two groups received saline and three groups received KA (AG Scientific, USA) (12mg/kg i.p. in saline). Two hours later the two saline groups received a second injection of either saline or DMSO:saline (40:60), and the three groups receiving KA were administered either saline, DMSO:saline (40:60) or JAK4D (1mg/kg i.p. in DMSO:saline 40:60). KA-treated rats were observed to develop characteristic KA-induced behaviors, including wet-dog shakes, head bobbing, forelimb clonus, foaming at mouth and seizures, for 2-3 h following KA injection. One animal died within the first 24 h following KA treatment. Following day one, all animals were allowed to recover for 3 days before commencement of MWM testing. During this time, animals were given a daily injection as per their second injection on day one, i.e., either saline, DMSO:saline (40:60) or JAK4D (1mg/kg i.p. in DMSO:saline 40:60). On Day 4, testing was commenced using standard MWM trials as previously described (Gobbo and O\u2019Mara, 2005). Daily injections of treatments as above were continued through the second day of water maze testing. Each animal undertook 5 trials per day, with approximately 20 sec between each trial, for 5 consecutive days. Swim paths, escape latency and swim speed were recorded by an automated tracking system (EthoVision; Noldus, Wageningen, Netherlands). On the day following the last day of escape latency testing, a probe test was carried out to assess reference memory at the end of learning (Vorhees and Williams, 2006). In this test the platform was removed from the pool and rats were placed in the pool and allowed to swim for a 60 sec period. Swim paths were digitally tracked and total time spent in the former zone of the platform was recorded Statistical analyses of MWM data were performed by an independent biostatistician. Data from the three independent experiments were pooled and analyzed with ANOVA using SPSS with factors representing Day, Group and Day x Group interactions. Since there was no heterogeneity between control groups in which animals received a first injection of saline followed by a second injection of either saline (n=13) or DMSO:saline (40:60) (n=9), these were collapsed for analysis. Likewise, data from the two groups receiving KA followed by saline (n=10) or DMSO:saline (40:60) (n=13) were also collapsed for analysis. A repeated measures design was used, employing the Greenhouse-Geisser three-step approach to significance testing where relevant. In this case, we report the uncorrected degrees of freedom, the corrected p value and the epsilon value of the correction factor. Post hoc tests were calculated to follow up significant effects.",

        "text": "2.5 Intrastriatal Microdialysis KA Model. The formation of highly reactive oxygen species (hROS), which provides a measure of oxidative stress commonly associated with the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders (Cavalli et al., 2008; Freinbichler et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2008), can be evoked in a dose-dependent manner by local application of an excitotoxic concentration of KA into rat striatum. hROS can be sensitively quantified as OH-TA, the hydroxylated derivative of sodium terephthalate (TA2-) (Freinbichler et al., 2011, 2008). This method was used to assess the ability of JAK4D to protect against in vivo free radical formation induced by intrastriatal administration of KA (1 mM)Male Wistar rats (200-220 g) anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg i.p.) were placed in a stereotaxic frame. A microdialysis guide cannula (concentric design, CMA/Microdialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) was implanted vertically in the right neostriatum (stereotaxic coordinates for neostriatum, relative to Bregma, were AP 0.7, L 3.2, DV 5.5 mm). Appoximately 48 h later, microdialysis experiments were performed on freely-moving rats, always starting at 9:00 am, by inserting the microdialysis probe (4mm exposed surface; CMA/Microdialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) into the guide cannula. The perfusion fluid, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), comprised: 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM Na2HPO4, 0.27 mM NaH2PO4 and 7.2 mM glucose (pH 7.4), plus 1 mM sodium terephthalate (TA2-) used as a chemical trap for highly reactive oxygen species (hROS) (Freinbichler et al., 2011). After a 60 min stabilization period, the dialysate samples were collected every 20 min. Initially, two fractions were collected to determine basal levels. At 60 min, the two KA-treated groups received an i.p. injection of either vehicle (15% DMSO in saline) or JAK4D (10 mg/kg in vehicle); the control group, not receiving KA, was administered JAK4D i.p. (10 mg/kg in vehicle). The rats were anesthetized (chloral hydrate 400 mg/kg i.p.) just before KA (1 mM) was applied to the neostriatum for 20 min from 100-120 min through the dialysis probe to the two KA-treated groups. Reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of 2- hydroxyterephthalate (OH-TA) in microdialysates was carried out using a Shimadzu instrument (Italia S.r.l., Milan, Italy) with a fluorescence detector (\u03bbex = 315 nm; \u03bbem = 435 nm) (Freinbichler et al., 2011).48 h after KA administration, animals were killed by decapitation, the brain removed, and the isolated neostriatum fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer solution for 72 h. Following paraffin inclusion, slices of the neostriatum (5 micron thick) were cut with a microtome. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Biotin-dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) immunohistochemistry, using the Klenow fragELMT DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit (Inalco, Milan, Italy), was applied to identify apoptotic nuclei. For Caspase-3 analysis, slices, after deparaffinization and rehydration, underwent permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by inactivation of endogenous peroxidase (30 min in 0.3% H2O2 in PBS) and serum blocking (5% donkey serum in PBS). They were then incubated overnight with the primary antibody (1:200 Anti-Active Caspase 3 (Promega)) and the next day for1 h with the secondary antibody (1:500 Biotin Conjugated Donkey Anti-rabbit p AB (Jackson ImmunoResearch)). For both TUNEL and Caspase-3, quantitative image analysis was performed using the public domain software Scion Image (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA) using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope (Nikon Instruments S.p.A., Firenze, Italy) equipped with a JVC SLR camera. For TUNEL and Caspase-3 analyses, three to six and three to four fields were counted respectively, corresponding to approximately 2000\u20135000 nuclei. For IBA1 immunolabeling to detect microglial activation, sections were first deparaffinized, gradually hydrated, and finally washed twice in 0.01M PBS solution pH 7.4. The tissue was first treated with 0.3% H2O2 for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity, then with 5% blocking donkey serum in PBS for 5 min to reduce background or unspecific staining. Sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibody (1:500, Anti-IBA1 (WAKO Chemicals GmbH, Germany)) diluted in 0.1M PBS, 5% donkey serum. The following day, sections were washed twice with PBS and then incubated for 10 min with the secondary antibody (1:500, Biotinylated anti-Rabbit IgG Antibody during brain microdialysis. Histochemical ex vivo tissue analysis was employed to assess related apoptotic striatal tissue damage.(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, USA)) in 0.1M PBS. The antigen-antibody complex was then visualized by the Vectastain ABC peroxidase kit (1:200, Vector Laboratories, USA). Finally, sections were washed and developed using 0.05% DAB (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy).",

Plate and liquid handling were performed using Echo 550, (Labcyte), Janus Automated Workstation, (PerkinElmer), Multidrop 384, (Thermo Scientific), Viaflo 384 (Integra Bioscience) and Multiflo FX Multi-Mode Dispenser (BioTek). Cell seeding and assay were carried out in black with clear bottom 384 well plates (BD Falcon, 353962). The Library and plating thereof was provided by the Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS). Images were acquired by either using ImageXpress Micro system (Molecular Devices LLC) with a 10 x objective or IN Cell Analyzer 2200 (GE Healthcare) with a 4 x objective and quantitative image analyses were run in CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) (Jones et al., 2008). Analysis of high content imagining data was performed using TIBCO Spotfire and additional statistical analyses were carried out with Microsoft Excel and Graphpad Prism softwares. For the primary HTS screening, U2OS cells were trypsinized and resuspended in culture medium. The cell suspension (500 cells in 25ml per well) was dispensed into 384-well plates (BD Falcon, 353962) and incubated overnight at 37 C in a5%CO2 atmosphere. The following day, 5 ml of 30 mM PR-peptide was added into the plates to get a final concentration of 5 mM of and, after 24h, 10 ml of a 40 mM solution in culture media of each of the compounds (kept at a 10 mM solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) were transferred to cells to keep a final compound concentration of 10 mM and a DMSO volume concentration of 0.1%. The cells were incubated for another 24h before fixation. Cells were fixed and stained with 2% formaldehyde and 2 mM Hoechst 33342 for 20 min, respectively. Plates were imaged using an IN Cell Analyzer 2200 system with a 4x objective. To identify compounds that prevent the cell death induced by PR20 peptides, 4-field images or 1-field images covering 100% of the well were taken for each treatment. All acquired images were analyzed with CellProfiler using a self-made pipeline that was based on detecting and counting Hoechst stained nuclei. Nuclei with a size smaller than 8 mm2 and with high intensity were not considered for count and thus excluded. The chemical collection used in the primary screening contained 4,126 pharmacologically active compounds from the following libraries: Prestwick, Tocris mini, Selleck tool compounds, Selleck known kinase inhibitors and ENZO tool compounds as well as 115 covalent drugs synthesized by Henriksson M. (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden). For the secondary \u2018\u2018epigenetic\u2019\u2019 screening, U2OS cells were seeded at 125 cells per well in 30 ml in 384-well plate (BD Falcon, 353962) and incubated overnight at 37 C in a5%CO2 atmosphere. The next day, either 10 ml of 40, 12 or 4 mMcompound was added into the plate to get 10, 3 or 1 mMof final concentration respectively. After 72h, the medium was changed to fresh medium containing 10, 3, or 1 mMcompound in a total volume of 40 ml and 24h later, 5 ml of 45 mMPR-peptide was added into each plate for an additional 48h to keep 5 mMof final concentration. After fixation with 100% ice-cold methanol for 5min, cells were subsequently counter-stained with 2 mM Hoechst 33342 for 20 min and the plate was scanned using IN Cell Analyzer 2200 (GE healthcare) with a 4 x objective. The chemical collection used in the secondary screening contained 94 epigenetics compounds consisting of the following libraries: ENZO Epigenetics v1.0 (43 compounds), Selleck tool compounds (HDAC) (11 compounds) and SGC bromodomain probe (40 compounds).",

Briefly, U2OS (1.53104 cells/ml) and NSC-34 (3.53105 cells/ml) cells were plated onto 96 well plates and the following day, NSC-34 cells were differentiated for 48h. U2OS and differentiated NSC-34 cells were pre-treated with compounds for 48h and 24h, followed by exposure to PR20 for 24h and 48h respectively at the indicated concentrations. For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed and permeabilized with either 100% ice-cold methanol for 5min, or 4% PFA for 15 min specifically for UBF and Active Caspase 3 staining, and subsequently treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10min at room temperature. After blocking (3% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS) for 30min, the indicated concentration of primary antibodies was applied: HA (1:200, Roche, 11 583 816 001), Fibrillarin (1:1000, Abcam, ab5821), UBF (1:500, Santa Cruz, sc-13125), Active Caspase 3 (1:500, Abcam, ab13847) and Tubulin beta 3 (1:1000, Biolegend, 801202).

An unbiased strategy was used to detect changes in the indicated protein levels. For this purpose, protein signal was quantified in the nucleoli as well as in the nucleus, using FIBRILLARIN and DAPI as counterstaining. For immunofluorescence on zebrafish, sections from the embryos were processed, fixed and permeabilized as indicated above. After permeabilization, followed by blocking in 3% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS for 1h, sections were incubated with anti-Fibrillarin antibody (1:500, Abcam, ab4566) at 4 C over-night, and subsequently incubated with anti-mouse IgG-647 (1:1000, Life technologies, A21235) for 1h at room temperature.

Twelve weeks old female SOD1*G93A mice and their non-transgenic littermates were treated intraperitoneally by use of Alzet osmotic minipumps (Alzet osmotic minipumps, model #1004, Alzet, USA). SOD1*G93A mice were treated with 10 mg per minipump equalling 19 mg/kg/d RD2RD2 (n = 12) or with physiological saline at pH 7.0 (placebo n = 10) as control group. Non-transgenic littermates (ntg = 13) were treated intraperitoneally with placebo exactly like the transgenic placebo group. The RD2RD2 dosage was chosen based on successful former experiments with related compounds. RD2RD2 was dissolved in sterile physiological saline at pH 7.0 and placed in minipumps for 24 h prior to implantation. The next day, the pumps were implanted intraperitoneally. In short, mice were anaesthetised with isoflurane, the skin and the muscle layer below was cut in the midline and the pump was inserted in the abdominal cavity. Following placement of the pump, the wound was sutured. All mice received three days of carprofen treatment after surgery (day of surgery plus two days after). Mice were monitored regularly for possible complications related to the surgical intervention and were medically attended. The sutures were removed aseptically approximately 7 to 10 days after surgery.",

Cells in each well were transfected with 0.3 \u03bcg Mito-DSred at DIV6-7 using 0.8 \u03bcL Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher Sientific, Waltham, MA 02451) and imaged at DIV8-9. Small molecule libraries were obtained from ICCB-Longwood (https://iccb.med.harvard.edu/). Compounds were pin-transferred into Greiner 384 well plates (cat#784201) at the ICCB-Longwood facility and immediately added to the cells using Agilent Bravo Liquid Handling Platform (Agilent, 5301 Stevens Creek Blvd, Santa Clara, CA 95051). Cells were incubated with compounds at 3\u03bcM for 1 h before and during time-lapse imaging. The plates were dosed and imaged one at a time. Z-scores were calculated for each parameter using the formula Z = (x-\u03bc)/\u03c3. A cutoff of Z-score > 3 in KS integrated distance was used to identify hits. Dose-response curves were performed using either six to eight quarter-log concentration increments with maximum values reaching the concentration used in the screen (3 \u03bcM). Concentrations (in nM) were transformed to log nM and values were internally normalized from low to high as percentage activity.

Neurons were imaged on an ArrayScan XTI imaging platform (ThermoFisher Sientific, Waltham, MA 02451). 30 frames per field were acquired at the maximum speed of 2 Hz. Four fields were imaged per well of a 96-well plate containing 30,000 rat hippocampal neurons/well at DIV08-09 using a 20X objective with 2x2 binning. To minimize well to well differences in exposure to compounds, the fields were imaged according to this sequence: field 1 was imaged in every well before returning to the start of the plate and imaging field 2 in every well, and similarly for fields 3 and 4. Imaging one field per well for 96 wells took ~30 min when acquiring 30 frames at 2Hz in each well. As a result, collecting a series from each of the 4 fields took a total of 2 h per 96-well plate. This protocol was used for the primary screen, compound retesting, and dose response curves in Figure 2, as well as for all experiments in Figures 3, 4, and 6A\u20136C.

The outcome of the Cell Profiler analysis was processed in MATLAB\u00ae (MathWorks, 1 Apple Hill Drive, Natick, MA 01760) using a custom script with a graphic user interface that represents data at the field and plate levels, creates heat-maps, and performs statistical computations such as Z-scores and KS statistics. TMRM levels were analyzed using ImageJ. Briefly, TMRM-labeled mitochondria were analyzed from areas of the wells lacking Mito-DsRed due to the low transfection efficiency.

Transfection with the HB9::GFP reporter was performed as described in Wainger et al. (2014). A 1kb HB9 promoter fragment (gift from Hynek Wichterle) controlling the expression of myristoylated GFP was inserted into a donor plasmid specific for the AAVS1 locus (Sigma). Subsequently, 2.5 million iPS cells were single-cell dissociated using accutase and electroporated using the Neon transfection system (100ul tip; 1600V Voltage, 20ms Width, 1 Pulse; Life Technologies) with 2 g of AAVS1 ZFN plasmid and 6 g of modified AAVS1 donor plasmid. After nucleofection cells were plated on matrigel with mTeSR1 in the presence of ROCK inhibitor. After 48hrs, puromycin selection was applied and surviving clonal colonies were individually passaged and gDNA was extracted. PCR was used to confirm proper targeting of the cassette. Primer sequences are available upon request. Faithful expression of the reporter was verified using expression of the motor neuron marker Isl1 (Abcam (Ab109517), 1:1000) and the pan-neuronal marker Map2 (Milipore (MAB378), 1:1000). Stem cell cultures were differentiated into motor neurons as previously described in Kiskinis et al. (2014). Briefly, iPSCs were dissociated to single cells and plated in suspension in low-adherence flasks (400k/mL), in mTeSR media with 10uM ROCK inhibitor. Media was gradually diluted (50% on day 3 and 100% on day 4) to KOSR (DMEM/F12, 10% KOSR) between days 1-4 and to a neural induction medium (NIM: DMEM/F12 with L-glutamine, NEAA, Heparin (2 ug/mL), N2 supplement (Invitrogen) for days 5-24.

On day 24 floating cell aggregates were dissociated into single cells with Papain/DNase (Worthington Bio) and HB9::GFP positive cells isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Subsequently, 30k motor neurons were plated onto poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated 96 well plates together with 30k mouse primary glial cells (P1). Cell cultures were fed every 2-3 days with complete Neurobasal media containing L-glutamine, NEAA, glutamax, N2 and B27, with BDNF/CNTF/GDNF (10 ng/mL, R&D) and ascorbic acid (0.2 ug/mL, Sigma).

        "text": "Quantification of motor neurons. Stereological methods were employed to quantify the number of motor neurons (MNs) in the ventral horn of lumbar cord using an Optical Fractionator probe. A computer software package, StereoInvestigator (MicroBright-Field, Colchester, VT), interfaced with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope equipped with Ludl motorized stage, Optronics Microfire color digital camera with 1600\u00d71200 resolution and Heidenheim Z axis encoder was used to collect and analyze the stereological data. Using the StereoInvestigator\u2019s optical fractionator probe, the total number of MNs was estimated from coded slides. To count each case we used 4 section, each 1080 \u03bcm apart (one every 16 sections). The area of interest, the ventral horn defined as the anterior subdivision of the gray matter to the middle of the central canal, was traced in the CV stained sections at \u00d74 magnification. The size of the counting frame was 75\u00d775\u03bcm and the area counted (XY) = 5625\u03bcm2. Cell counting was performed using a \u00d760 N.A 1.4 oil objective. Neurons were only counted if their diameter was 15\u03bcm or larger and only if the neuron nucleolus was inside the counting frame and the neuron was not touching the excluding borders. The computer cursor was set at 15\u03bcm long for easy detection of cells that meets the 15\u03bcm diameter criterion. Neurons were marked with two different marker depending on size, 30\u03bcm diameter or larger and smaller than 30\u03bcm but larger than 15\u03bcm. These MNs referred in text as small and large MNs, respectively.",

        "text": "Mutant SOD1-induced cytotoxicity protection assay. Viability and EC50 values were determined according to the previously reported assay procedure.17 PC12 cells were seeded at 15000 cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated 24 h prior to compound addition. Compounds were assayed in 12-point dose-response experiments to determine potency and efficacy. The highest compound concentration tested was 32 \u03bcM, which was decreased by one-half with each subsequent dose. After 24 h incubation with the compounds, MG132 was added at a final concentration of 100 nM. MG132 is a well-characterized proteasome inhibitor, which would be expected to enhance the appearance of protein aggregation by blocking the proteosomal clearance of aggregated proteins. Cell viability was measured 48 h later using the fluorescent viability probe, Calcein-AM (Molecular Probes). Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS, Calcein-AM was added at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcM for 20 min at room temperature, and fluorescence intensity was read in a POLARstar fluorescence plate reader (BMG). Fluorescence data were coupled with compound structural data, then stored and analyzed using the CambridgeSoft Chemoffice Enterprise Ultra software package.",

        "text": "Animal studies. Equal number of SOD1(G93A)-mutant mice of the same gender from same litter were randomly divided into two groups. Littermates with same gender were randomly assigned to each group which had 12 mice (6 male and 6 female). The strain of the mutant SOD1(G93A) mice is B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1G93A)1Gur/J (Jackson Laboratory). The mice purchased from Jackson were not used immediately. The SOD1(G93A) male from Jackson mated with wild-type C57Bl/6 female, then male offspring were always mated with wild-type C57Bl/6 female mice. The resulting animals are on a background that involves C57BL/6 and SJL and express high levels of human SOD1 gene carrying a glycine to alanine transition at position 93 (G93A). The animal protocol used was approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute. Mice were treated from postnatal day 60 until the endpoints by i.p. injections with either 123C4 or the saline control. 123C4 was dissolved in normal saline at a concentration of 2 mg/mL and sterilized by a 0.2 \u03bcm filter. Mice were treated with 123C4 every day, at a dose of 30 mg/kg of body weight. Animals were assessed daily for the time of onset of hind limb tremor and loss of splay reflex. The endpoint was designated as the point when the mouse could no longer roll over within 10s after being pushed onto its side. At this stage, mice were killed. Disease onset and survival time were compared using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. Difference of survival time from disease onset to end point between 123C4 and saline-treated mice was analyzed with Student's t-test. Values are given as mean \u00b1 SD. Preliminary BBB penetration and PK studies were performed by Agilux (Cambridge, MA).",

Grip strength was assessed using a grip-strength meter (model 1027 DSM; Columbus Instruments). We decide to focus on forelimb grip strength, as it gives consistent readout (Yamanaka et al., 2008), while the hindlimb measurement is subject to high variability. Measurements of grip strength and animal weight usually start at P60. The baseline grip strength was calculated as the average of three peak grip strength values. There is an initial training period for the animals just before the first measurement on the same day. Animals were not trained to perform the grip strength task prior to P60.",

The clinical status of the ALS mice model was evaluated 3 times per week beginning at 60 days after birth. Symptom onset was defined as shaking of the limbs when the mouse was suspended in the air by its tail, which may be due to the clinical involvement of the upper motor neuron system [26]. At this stage, clonus, hyperreflexia, and crossed spread of spinal reflexes were also detectable in most mice. The endpoint was defined when the mice were unable to right themselves within 30 s after being placed on their sides on a flat surface, and the animals were sacrificed. Rotarod test was conducted in a single-blind fashion [27]. Mice were subjected to a 1-week learning period 53 days after birth, during which they were able to perform on an accelerating rotarod. The rotarod test was performed over 3 days a week. The time spent walking on the rotarod was measured, and the time evaluated through 3 repeats was averaged. When the mean time was less than 10 s, it was defined as rotarod failure.",

For cresyl violet staining, the lumbar spinal cords were removed after perfusion fixation, paraffin-embedded, and 20 \u03bcm thick trans-sections were cut on a microtome and mounted on a glass slide. Sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, incubated with 0.1% cresyl violet for 6 min, differentiated with 0.05% lithiumcarbonate solution, and observed under a microscope. Motor neuron cell with staining in the anterior horn of the lumbar spinal cord was counted. To evaluate the effect of GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition on the ALS mice model, western blotting of GSK-3\u03b2, phospho-GSK- 3\u03b2 and antibodies of extrinsic apoptosis signals was performed. For western blotting, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and intracardiac perfusion of PBS was carried out. Subsequently, the spinal cord of eachmouse was quickly removed, cooled in ice-cold artificial CSF for 5min, and stored in a \u221280 \u00b0C freezer.

One and four days after seeding, the culture medium with NTFs was replaced with the same medium supplemented with different drugs (see treatments below). To assess neuronal survival, the number of large phase-bright cells with long neurites in the total area of triplicate wells for each condition was counted 72 h after the last treatment. Data were obtained from at least three independent experiments. The mean number of surviving cells (in percent) was normalised taking the \u2018NTF medium alone\u2019 treatment as 100%.

To determine the onset of motor dysfunction in ALS(SOD1G93A) transgenic mice, we adopted both balance beam and grip strength tests. Grip strength test was assessed using a traction meter (BrainScience Idea Co., Ltd.). Each mouse was given three trials, and the highest limb strength score was recorded. For ALS(SOD1G93A) transgenic mice, grip strength tests were started at 11 weeks of age and performed twice a week until an over 20% reduction compared with the initial limb strength score at 11 weeks of age was observed. Finally, a grade 3 in the balance beam test [10] and over 20% reduction of limb strength score were defined as the sign of the disease onset in ALS(SOD1G93A) transgenic mice",

        "text": "Assessment of Motor Function. We assessed motor performance and coordination, and balance in the mice by the balance-beam test, vertical pole test, and footprint analysis as previously described in detail [10] and grip strength test as described above. In brief, the balance-beam test was performed every day after the onset until mice were unable to stay on the bar. Each mouse was given a maximum of five vertical pole trials using the following two criteria; 1) a cutoff of 45cm and 2) the task was terminated when mouse reached the vertical ascending distance of 45 cm. The highest vertical ascending distance was scored. The footprint trial was conducted at 18 and 21 weeks of age in ALS(SOD1H46R) mice and at 12, 16, and 20 weeks of age in ALS(SOD1G93A) mice. Grip strength test of ALS(SOD1H46R) mice was started at 17 weeks of age and performed once a week. To evaluate the spontaneous motor activities in mice, we conducted cage activity and rearing performance tests by using SUPERMEX with infrared ray sensor monitor (Muromachi Kikai). Both cage activity and rearing performance were monitored for 2 consecutive nights starting at 18 weeks and 21 weeks of age in ALS(SOD1H46R) mice and at 13 weeks, 17 weeks and 21 weeks of age in ALS(SOD1G93A) mice. The cumulative counts of cage activity and rearing performance for the darkperiod (12 h; 19:00\u20137:00) were analyzed. The ALS(SOD1H46R) mice that accidentally died or showed unmeasurable scores on vertical pole test, grip strength test and/or stride length at 21\u201322 weeks of age (late-symptomatic stage) were omitted from the statistical analyses.",

All research involving live mice was approved by a University of Melbourne Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee (#1312908) and conformed with guidelines of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. Hemizygous mice expressing a transgene for human SOD1 containing the G93A substitution mutation (SOD1G93A) on the mixed B6/SJL background were from the Jackson Laboratories (strain B6SJL-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1GurJ) and generously provided by Prize4Life. Nontransgenic littermates were used as a control. Prior to treating, mice were allocated based on sex and litter to either the \u201csurvival\u201d cohort or the \u201cbiochemical\u201d cohort. Mice in the survival cohort were kept through to phenotypic end-point to collect data on the effects of treatment on survival and symptom progression, and mice in the biochemical cohort were killed at the age of 120 days to collect tissues for biochemical analyses. Within each cohort individual mice were allocated based on sex and litter to either the sham treatment or the CuII(atsm) treatment group. All treatments were thus spread evenly across sexes, litters and genotypes. Treatment commenced when the mice were 50 days old. Sham treatment involved gavage with standard suspension vehicle (SSV; 0.9% w/v NaCl, 0.5% w/v Na-carboxymethylcellulose, 0.5% v/v benzyl alcohol, 0.4% v/v Tween-80). CuII(atsm) treatment involved gavage using SSV supplemented with CuII(atsm). CuII(atsm) was synthesised as described previously5,45. Dose of CuII(atsm) administered to each animal was 50 mg kg\u22121 body weight. Treatments were administered twice daily, 7 days week\u22121 through to phenotypic end-point (survival cohort) or until the mice reached 120 days of age (biochemical cohort).",

        "text": "SOD1 activity. SOD1 activity in TBS-soluble tissue extracts (described above) was assessed via a pyrogallol assay based on published procedures46,47. Pyrogallol (Sigma) was added to a reaction buffer (50 mM Tris, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 200 \u03bc M and allowed to equilibrate for 1 minute. TBS-soluble tissue extracts were added then reaction mixtures monitored at 325 nm. Reaction mixtures supplemented with 10 mM KCN were used to determine the KCN-sensitive activity attributable to SOD1. SOD1 activity was determined by calculating the rate of change through the linear phase of reaction. Reactions mixtures containing equivalent volumes of TBS homogenising buffer \u00b1 KCN were included as additional controls. For experiments in which tissue extracts were supplemented with Cu2+ (Fig. 3), TBS-soluble extracts were incubated with CuCl2 (final Cu2+ concentration = 10 \u03bc M) overnight at 4 \u00b0C before performing the activity assay.",

Lumbar 4~5 spinal cord samples were isolated, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h, dehydrated stepwise in gradient sucrose and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 \u03bcm) of spinal cord were stained with hematoxylin-eosin or cresyl violet for pathological examination. For immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, sections were boiled for 10 min with sodium citrate for antigen retrieval followed by incubating with primary antibody GFAP, Iba1, CHAT, or TrkB in 0.3% Triton X-100 phosphate buffer saline (PBS) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Rabbit-specific HRP/DAB (ABC) Detection IHC Kit was used for immunohistochemistry. Briefly, after incubation with the primary antibody, sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-polyvalent for 10 min and washed with PBS, streptavidin peroxidase for another 10 min and washed with PBS, DAB diluent for 2-5 min and washed with water. Finally, sections were stained with hematoxylin, dehydrated with 100-70% gradient ethanol and cleared with xylene. For immunofluorescence, after incubated with primary antibody, sections were washed with PBS followed by incubation with fluorescent secondary antibody 488 or 568 and washed with PBS. Finally, sections were stained with DAPI, washed with PBS and covered with film. All histological sections were examined with a light microscope and analyzed with Image-pro plus 6.2 software.",

        "text": "C. elegans transgenic strains and lifespan assay. C. elegans were raised on Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) plates seeded with OP50 E. Coli at 20 \u00b0C. The strains used were N2 Bristol, plEx102[Punc- 47::SOD1::SL2::mStrawberry, Pmyo-2::mStrawberry], and plEx104[Punc-47::SOD1G93A::SL2::mStrawberry, Pmyo-2:: mStrawberry]. To generate the transgenic strains expressing human wild type SOD1 or mutant SOD1G93A in D-type motor neurons of C. elegans, we created two plasmids that include the unc-47 promoter and cDNA of SOD1 or SOD1G93A followed by a spliced leader SL2 and mStrawberry (Punc-47: :SOD1::SL2::mStrawberry and Punc-47::SOD1G93A: :SL2::mStrawberry). SOD1 cDNA and SOD1G93A cDNA were amplified from addgene plasmids #26407 and #26411, respectively. The cDNA region of newly generated plasmids was confirmed by sequencing. Microinjections were performed following standard protocol. Each plasmid DNA in the transgenic strains was injected into N2 Bristol at a concentration of 25 ng/\u03bcL. Two independent transgenic lines of each strain were generated and tested for lifespan to confirm the results, while only the data from one transgenic line were shown for simplicity and clarity. Lifespan experiments were performed on NGM plates with a layer of OP50 either without or with 7,8-DHF at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL at 20 \u00b0C. Transgenic worms were identified by mStrawberry expression. For each lifespan assay, about 60-80 worms were included and transferred every other day to fresh NGM plates at a density of 15 worms per plate. The first day of adulthood was scored as day 1. Survival was scored every day, and the worms that crawled off the plate, hatched inside, or exploded were censored. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 8 (GraphPad). p values were calculated using the log-rank (Kaplan-Meier) method.",

Because the heterogeneous genetic background of the study mice results in significantly different survival times between males and females (Heiman-Patterson et al., 2003), male mice were used in all experiments. In the present experiment, mice were fed Purina 5002 (Purina Mills, St. Louis, MO) rodent chow\u00a0ad libitum, supplemented with 240 ppm pioglitazone (ActosTM; Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Osaka, Japan). The latter drug concentration was chosen because only 18% of pioglitazone crosses the blood-brain barrier in mammals as described in detail by others (Maeshiba et al., 1997). The final dosage of drug was computed to be 40 mg \u00b7 kg-1\u00a0\u00b7 d-\u00a0of pioglitazone based on an average daily food consumption of 5 g of chow per mouse. Of note, pioglitazone does not affect blood glucose levels in mice as determined in a set of pilot experiments using the identical treatment protocol in accordance with previous observations in nondiabetic mice (Shiomi et al., 2002).",

        "text": "Immunohistochemistry. Four to six mice per group were used for the analyses on the cellular and molecular levels. The mice were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and killed by cervical dislocation. Two different dissection, fixation, and staining protocols were used. First, for bright-field motor neuron immunohistochemistry, the lumbar parts of the spinal cord were dissected out quickly and immersion fixed in Bouin Hollande fixative, containing 4% (w/v) picric acid, 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde, and 1% (v/v) glacial acetic acid. The tissue was embedded in paraffin, cut with a microtome at 7 \u03bcm thickness, and mounted on silanized glass slides. Sections were then stained for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity essentially as described in detail previously (Schutz et al., 2004). For the quantification of motor neurons, CGRP-positive cell bodies were counted on six sections per animal and the mean number per section calculated. To avoid false double counting, the sections were 49 \u03bcm apart from each other. Immunohistochemical detection of microglia was performed by staining with a rat monoclonal antibody against murine CD11b (diluted 1:250; catalog #MCA711; Serotec, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany) and visualized by using the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method (ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. For quantification, the microglia were subdivided into three activation states (resting, intermediate, activated) according to their morphological appearance and the number quantified per section.Second, for the simultaneous fluorescent immunohistochemical detection of motor neurons and microglia, freshly dissected pieces of lumbar spinal cord were frozen quickly in isopentane at -40\u00b0C. Eight micrometer sections were cut with a cryostat and mounted on silanized glass slides. The slides were dried at room temperature overnight and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Retrieval of antigen sites, blocking of endogenous peroxidase activity, and blocking of nonspecific binding sites was performed according to standard protocols. Double staining was performed by adding simultaneously both first antibodies followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C. Immunoreactions were visualized with goat secondary antibodies (cyanine 3-conjugated anti-rabbit, diluted 1:150; Alexa488-conjugated anti-rat, diluted 1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Negative controls included omission of the primary and secondary antibodies.\n\nEvaluation of the spinal cord motor neuron area by CGRP immunohistochemistry",

The specificity of the SOD-100 antibody was confirmed by a negative (wild-type mouse brain total protein) control (data not shown). The SOD-101 antibody predominantly detected mouse SOD1 but in addition showed minimal cross-reactivity with human SOD1. The blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and developed using chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Afterward, the blots were stripped and stained with a monoclonal anti-\u03b2-actin antibody at 1:10,000 dilution (Sigma Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany).\n\nSpinal cord samples from 90-d-old mice were processed for total RNA and protein, and both mouse and human SOD1 expression levels were determined using quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting.",

We did not explore quadratic or othermodels of dose-response.) We also calculated the timefrom disease onset of signs to death, as an additionaloutcome measure. Outcome measures were stratifiedby sex and by exercise (wheel in cage or not), and theanalysis was further refined using Cox regression, withtreatment group, sex, and exercise (wheel in cage or not)as covariates. For those groups in running wheels, thenumber of wheel-turns per half hour was averaged over aweek, and the weekly average for each treated group wascompared to control using a t test (planned comparison).",

All neuropathology sectionswere scored by a single veterinary neuropathologist(JK), blinded to treatment group. Eight sections weretaken from each animal (brain with thalamus, brainwith midbrain, brain with cerebellum and medulla,cervical cord, upper thoracic cord, lower thoracic cord,lumbar cord, sacral cord). In addition, the diaphragm andparaspinal and gastrocnemius muscles were examinedfor each animal. Each section was examined and scoredfor (where appropriate): neuronal necrosis, neuronalvacuolation, astrogliosis, axonal degeneration, muscleatrophy.

        "text": "Motor Neuron Differentiation Protocol. HBG3 mouse ES cells express GFP under the control of the hb9 promoter and are useful to identify neurons with a MN phenotype. HBG3 cells were differentiated as previously described (41). Briefly, HBG3 cells were expanded on mitotically inactive mouse embryonic fibroblasts cultured with knockout DMEM supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin-streptomycin solution (Gibco, USA), 15% ES cell-tested fetal calf serum (Wisent, Canada), and 1000 U/ml of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; Chemicon, USA) to maintain their pluripotency. They were subsequently plated on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates and grown to 80% confluency whereupon they were tripsinized and seeded in suspension in bacterial plates to form embryoid bodies (EBs). Such EBs were cultured in ES cell medium for 2 days and subsequently treated with 2 \u03bcM RA (Sigma, USA), together with varying concentrations of recombinant human SHH (R&D Systems, USA), for 4 additional days. Finally, EBs were dissociated using a 0.2% papain/1 mM L-cysteine solution, and the resulting cell suspension was either reseeded on Matrigel-coated plates with DFNK differentiation medium consisting of DMEM:F12 and neurobasal medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin-streptomycin solution (Gibco), and knockout serum replacement (Gibco) to perform immunocytochemistry analyses, or used for transplantation studies.",

To identify key markers of MN differentiation, immunocytochemistry analyses were performed on differentiated cultures as described previously (12,28,38). Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cultures were washed three times with PBS and blocked by incubation with 10% normal goat serum/0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 45 min. The following primary antibodies were used at the indicated dilutions in 10% serum/PBS: rabbit anti-GFP 1:500 (Molecular Probes, USA), mouse anti-\u03b2-tubulin III antibody 1:1000 (Covance, USA), mouse anti-islet1 (Isl1) antibody 1:2 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, USA), and goat anti-choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) antibody 1:200 (Chemicon, USA). Corresponding secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 (1:500; Molecular Probes, USA) were used. For ChAT detection, biotinylated anti-goat secondary antibody (1: 100), followed by incubation with Texas red-avidin (1: 200; Vector Laboratories, USA) was required. To label nuclei, 5 \u03bcM Hoechst 32258 dye was used. All experiments included cultures where primary antibodies were not added; unspecific staining was not observed in such negative controls. To estimate the proportion of MN induced by treatment of EBs with RA, alone or in combination with SHH, we quantified the percentage of GPF-positive cells from the total cell population in different experimental conditions: 1) 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, RA vehicle); 2) 2 \u03bcM RA; 3) 2 \u03bcM RA + 20 ng/ml SHH; 4) 2 \u03bcM RA + 50 ng/ml SHH; 5) 2 \u03bcM RA + 100 ng/ml SHH.\n\nwe determined the presence of molecular markers characteristic of this neuronal type through immunocytochemical analyses.",

Male transgenic rats were mated with wild-type (WT) Sprague-Dawley female rats, and the resulting offspring were genotyped by the presence of hSOD1G93A through a genomic DNA PCR protocol recommended by the distributor. Rats were identified by subcutaneous implantation of a microchip (Allflex). Tail biopsies from 1-month-old rats were digested in proteinase K and then diluted 1:20 in sterile H2O, followed by heating at 95\u00b0C for 15 min.

One day prior to the surgical procedure, cyclosporin A (10 mg/kg of body weight daily) was injected IP, and this treatment continued daily until rats were euthanized. For transplantation, animals were deeply anesthetized with sevofluorane (5% for induction, 1% for maintenance) with the aid of a vaporizer. An incision was made above the lumbar region to expose the vertebrae. The vertebral column was secured to a stereotactic frame with the aid of clamps (Stoelting, USA) to perform laminectomy of L5. A small cut of the meninges was made to allow transplantation. Cell suspensions of differentiated ES cells were loaded on a microsyringe to unilaterally transplant 1 \u00d7 105 cells in 1 \u03bcl into the ventral gray matter (0.5 mm lateral to the midline and 1.5 mm ventral from the dorsal surface of the spinal cord). Sham rats were injected with 1 \u03bcl of DFNK medium. We performed the transplantation procedure in a cohort (n = 4) of transgenic hSOD1G93A rats that received cells previously labeled with 5 \u03bcM Hoechst 32258; these animals were sacrificed 1 week later to verify transplant location and to establish the presence of ChAT+ and GFP+ cells.

In a previous study using BDNF, we reported the dose-dependent effect of the subcutaneous administration of BDNF between 5 and 20 mg/kg, the latter of which was optimal [23]. Thus, in thisinvestigation, we performed a blinded study with vehicle(phosphate-buffered saline, PBS), 5, 20, and 40 mg/kgBDNF (n = 10 for each group) to observe the reproducibility and the maximal effects of BDNF. Riluzole study 1 was anopen-label study with a vehicle control and 100 and 200 Ag/ml riluzole for 2 weeks (n = 4, 5, and 5, respectively), which was performed to determine an effective dose of riluzole for improving grip strength and to measure the serum concentration of riluzole after 2 weeks of treatment. In this study,the normal littermates that were kept in pairs with the wobbler mice were also tested for grip strength and theserum concentration of riluzole, for comparisons with the affected wobbler mice. Riluzole study 2 was a blinded studyusing a vehicle control and 200 Ag/ml riluzole for 4 weeks (n = 10 for each group), to examine the effects of riluzole onbody weight, grip strength, rota-rod walking performance,the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) of the affected forelimb biceps and the numberof the cervical cord anterior horn neurons that were immuno reactivefor SMI-32. Because the CMAP amplitude inwobbler mice has not been reported in previous studies, we examined the natural history of the CMAP amplitude using additional untreated wobbler mice and normal littermates at the clinical onset, and 2 and 4 weeks after the onset (five wobbler mice and five normal littermates were used at eachtime point).",

For the natural history study, the CMAP amplitude was measured at clinical onset, and 2 and 4 weeks after the onset, in untreated wobbler mice and normal littermates. It was measured within 2 days of the final clinical assessment in the wobbler mice in the BDNF study and riluzole study 2. With the mouse under 1.5\u20132.5% halothane anesthesia, one of the forelimb biceps was exposed, and the ulnar, median,and central nerves were cut at the middle region of the biceps. A positive and a negative needle-electrodes (NE-223S, Nihonkoden, Japan) were placed on the distal and middle part of the biceps, respectively, and the ground was placed on the lower forelimb extensor muscle near the elbow. A bipolar stimulating electrode (IMA2-1508, Neuroscience) was placed on the musculocutaneous nerve nearthe brachial plexus. The CMAP was elicited by supramaximal stimulation (200 As, 4-s interval) and was recorded byan oscilloscope (VC-11A, Nihonkoden) with an amplifier (AVB-11B, Nihonkoden). The amplitude from a negative point to positive peak of the CMAP was analyzed with Powerlab/4s and Scope software (ADInstrument, Australia)on a Macintosh Powerbook G3 computer (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA, USA).",

After the measurements of CMAP amplitude in theriluzole study 2, animals were fixed by intracardiac perfusionwith cold PBS and then with 4% paraformaldehyde(PFA) in PBS. The C5 and C6 spinal cord was dissected out,post-fixed over-night with 4% PFA, and transferred to 30% sucrose solution. Serial 30 Am coronal sections were prepared by a cryostat, and every fifth sections were used for SMI-32 immunohistochemistry. After being washed with 0.1% Triton-X 100 in PBS(PBS-T), the free-floating sections were incubated at 4 jC with, sequentially, 3% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories,Burlingame, CA, USA) in PBS-T for 1 h, 1/1000SMI-32 (Sternberger Monoclonals, Lutherville, MD, USA)in PBS-T for overnight, and 1/500 biotinylated anti-mousegoat IgG (Vector Laboratories) in PBS-T for 1 h, each. The sections were then incubated at room temperature for 30min with 0.3% H2O2 in PBS, then with a preformed avidinand biotinylated horseradish peroxidase macromolecularcomplex in PBS (Vectastatin ABC kit, Vector Laboratories)for 1 h. Finally, the sections were reacted with 3, 3Vdiaminobenzidine(DAB substrate, Roche Diagnostics, Germany)according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Large SMI-32-positive neurons (z20 Am) with a clearnucleus that were within the anterior horn ventral to the horizontal line passing through the central canal werebilaterally counted in each section. All SMI-32-positiveneurons showing the vacuolar degeneration in the anteriorhorn were also counted. Sections from two animals each forvehicle and riluzole groups were excluded from the countingdue to the poor fixation and staining. Total 9.0F2.5 and8.3F1.7 sections per animal were analyzed for the vehicleand the riluzole group, respectively (n = 8 for both groups,meanFS.E.M., P= 0.49).\n\nThe effects of riluzole on the number of the cervical cord anterior horn motor neurons and on the vacuolar degeneration in wobbler mice were examined by immunohistochemistry.",

After 2 weeks of treatment in riluzole study 1, the animalswere deeply anesthetized with 2.5% halothane, and wholeblood was obtained from the heart with a 25-G needlesyringe.The blood sampling was performed between 10:00and 11:30 AM for all the wobbler mice (n = 14) and normallittermates (n = 14). This sampling time was chosen becausethe animals were found to be at rest and neither eating nordrinking around this time, and thus we expected that theserum concentration of riluzole might be relatively stable.The blood was spun to separate the serum, then 0.1 ml ofacetonitrile and 20 Al of 2-amino 6-methylbenzothiazole 10Ag/ml in methanol (Tokyo Kasei Kogyo, Japan) was added to0.1 ml of serum. The mixture was spun at 11,000 g for 5min (himac CT15D, Hitachi Koki, Japan), and the supernatantwas filtered by centrifugation through an ultra-free C3filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Ten microliters of theeluate was used for analysis with the LC-MS/MS system,which consists of an alliance HPLC system (Waters, Milford,MA, USA) and a TSQ-7000 mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA, USA). A Puresil C18 column (5 Am,2.1 mm i.d. 150 mm, Waters) was used to fractionate thesample. The mobile phase consisted of 40/60 (v/v) 1%aqueous acetic acid-acetonitrile, and was delivered at a flowrate of 0.2 ml/min. The mass spectrometer was equippedwith an electrospray ionization ion source, and was operatedin the Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) mode. To assaythe riluzole, the mass spectrometer was set to select the[M + 1]+ ion of m/z 235 for riluzole, and the [M + H]+ ion ofm/z 165 for 2-amino 6-methylbenzothiazole (internal standard)via the first quadrupole mass filter (Q1), while signalsfor the production of m/z 208 and 150 for the analyte andinternal standard, respectively, were monitored via the thirdquadrupole mass filter.\n\nTo determine an effective dose of riluzole for improving grip strength and to measure the serum concentration of riluzole after 2 weeks of treatment.",

Molecular docking analysis was performed by using MolecularOperating Environment software (version 2016. 08, ChemicalComputing Group Inc., Montreal, QC, Canada). The molecular model ofNMDA receptor was built from the X-ray co-crystal structure of NMDAreceptor (PDB: 4TLL) in complex with two ligands, an allosteric inhibitor(Ro25-6981) and partial agonists (MK-801). The crystallographicstructure was prepared using QuickPrep program of MOE inthe default setting. MN-06 and its parent compound memantine wereorganized in a MOE database file. The co-crystalized ligand MK-801aimed to identify the binding site on NMDA receptor. Docking experimentswere carried out using the default parameters of MOE(Placement: Triangle Matcher, Rescoring 1: London dG, Refinement:Rigid Receptor, Rescoring 2: GBVI/WSA dG).",

The earliest clinical signs observedwere tremors and shaking of their limbs when mice weresuspended briefly in the air by their tails. Progression of disease was measured by the decrement in the ability of mice to remainon the rotarod, by scoring, and by weight loss. The scoringsystem was on a scale of 1 to 5; with 1 as the endpoint foreuthanasia, and 5 as healthy with little or no signs of onset ofdisease. Animals were scored by lifting them gently by the baseof their tails and observing them for tremors, stiffness and theirability to extend their limbs. To determine \u201cmortality\u201d as anindependent measure and humanely, mice were euthanizedwhen they could not right themselves within 3 s after beingplaced on their sides (Klivenyi et al., 1999). The following is amore specific breakdown of the scoring system: 5=healthy; 4\u20135=mostly healthy, minor tremors, very active, extension of alllimbs; 4=visible minor tremors, extension of all limbs, veryactive; 3\u20134=tremors, with some minor stiffness, very active; 3=tremors, stiffness of limbs, maybe some minor paralysis,active; 2\u20133=tremors, partial paralysis, stiffness, extension oflimbs is labored, active; 2=paralysis, somewhat active; 1\u20132=paralysis of hind limbs, no extension of hind limbs,euthanasia may be performed dependent upon the activity ofthe animal and its ability to right itself within 3 s; 1=endpoint,animal unable to right itself.",

In brief, rhGAL-1 was expressedin Escherichia coli and purified from the supernatant of the sonicated E. coli by DEAE-HPLC. Oxidized galectin-1 was obtained from bacterially expressed rhGAL-1 by the air oxidation method with CuSO4 as a catalyst. DEAE purified rhGAL-1 was subsequently diluted 20-fold with 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, CuSO4 was added to a final concentration of 0.0001% (w/v), and the mixture was maintained overnight at 48C to allow disulfide boundformation.rhGAL-1/ox was then purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a YMC-pack Protein RP column (YMC) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purified rhGAL-1/ox contains three intramolecular disulfide linkages between Cys2 and Cys130, Cys16 and Cys88, andCys42 and Cys60, which represent a stable conformation of oxidized galectin-1. Analysis by SDS-PAGE and HPLC revealed that rhGAL-1/ox was not degenerated even after 10days of incubation at 378C in PBS (5 Al protein/ml).rhGAL-1/ox confirmed that the protein promotes axonal regeneration in both the in vitro examination (Horie et al.,2004) and in the in vivo acellular nerve regeneration model(Fukaya et al., 2003).",

        "text": "Experimental protocol. Kadoya et al. recently reported that the application of rhGAL-1/ox (0.125 Ag/body weight (g)/week) to the injured region promotes the restoration of nerve function using in vivo peripheral nerve regeneration model (Kadoya et al., inpress). No one showed any toxic effects in reaction to theadministration of rhGAL-1/ox. The concentration ofrhGAL-1/ox in the present study was chosen because previous investigation demonstrated the effect and safetyin an animal model and because a higher dose would be expected to promote the survival of the degenerating motorneurons. For the reasons above, 0.25 Ag/g (body weight)/week of rhGAL-1/ox was administered to the H46R SOD1Tg mice. Furthermore, intramuscular administration of rhGAL-1/ox was performed on a weekly basis in considering the application of rhGAL-1/ox to human ALS in the future.The Tg mouse littermates were randomly divided into two groups: (1) administration of rhGAL-1/ox of 0.25 Ag/g(body weight) (gal-1-treated group); and (2) administrationof 60 Al physiological saline (control group). rhGAL-1/ox was diluted with physiological saline and injected into the left gastrocnemius muscle using a microsyringe connected to a 27-gauge needle. The control group received physiological saline instead of rhGAL-1/ox. To clarify whether rhGAL-1/ox delays the onset of the disease,intramuscular injection was started prior to the early presymptomatic stage. At postnatal day 70 (10 weeks ofage), the mice started receiving a weekly intramuscular injection of rhGAL-1/ox or physiological saline. Twenty eight transgenic mice (gal-1-treated group, n = 14; controlgroup, n = 14) were used for the assessment of disease onset, life span, and duration of illness. Among them, 19 transgenic mice (gal-1-treated group, n = 10; control group, n = 9) were used for the assessment of motorfunction. Additional transgenic mice (gal-1-treated group,n = 6; control group, n = 5) were used for the histological and pathological investigation.",

We applied this kind of sigmoidal curve, already used in earlier studies (Danzeisenet al., 2006), because it best approximates the time course of running wheel activity. The time of disease onset (i.e. the onsetof motor symptoms) was estimated from the time\u2013performance curve (the days when mice reached 90% of their presymptomatic activity).",

Gross behavior of each animal was daily observed through visual inspection. In particular, hind limb movement and rearing behavior of each animal were weekly monitored by video camera from 12 weeks of age to the end stage. To determine the age at onset of motor dysfunction in transgenic mice, we adopted a balance beam test using the stainless steel bar (45 cm long and 0.9 cm indiameter). Motor function in the hind limbs was assessed at 12 weeks ofage, and weekly thereafter until the day at which mice were unable to stay on the bar.We used the following five arbitrary grades to evaluate the motor function of mice; grade 5 (enable to walk and change the directions on the bar without their hind limb slipping), grade 4 (occasionally showed a sign of hind limb slipping, but skill fully walk on the bar), grade 3(frequently showed a hind limb slipping, but still awkwardly walked on the bar), grade 2 (stay on the bar, but quickly fall off from the bar when attempt to walk), and grade 1 (unable to stay on the bar). In this study, the grade 3 was defined as the sign of the disease onset. Lifespan of animals was determined by the observations that mice have no longer had a heartbeat and breathing, and survival interval was calculated by the subtraction of the day of life span by the day of disease onset.",

At 13 weeks (pre-symptomatic stage; 1 week after the initial administration of L-745,870) and 22 weeks (late-symptomatic stage; after the administration of L-745,870 over a period of 10 weeks) of ages,the mice were anesthetized with halothane (4%) in a mixture of N2O/O2(70:30) and transcardially perfused with physiological saline containing 10% heparin, and lumbar spinal cord was removed. Tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl,0.1% NP-40, Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)), and was centrifuged at 22,000 \u00d7g for 30 min. The resultant supernatant was collected as a NP-40 soluble fraction. The insoluble pellet fraction was then suspended with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.2) containing 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sonicated, and left for 30 min at room temperature. After the centrifugation at 22,000 \u00d7g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected as a SDS-soluble fraction. Protein concentration of each fraction was determined by the Micro BCA system (Pierce).Ten \u03bcg of protein from each fraction was electrophoretically separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).Membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed-milk (Wako) in TBST buffer(50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Tween-20)overnight at 4 \u00b0C and was then incubated with the anti-SOD1 antibody  (dilution 1:10,000) inTBSTcontaining 1% skimmed-milk for 2 h at roomtemperature. After washing with TBST, membranes were incubated with the peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit IgG (#NA934, GEHealthcare UK Ltd, Buckinghamshire, UK) for 1 h at room temperature.Signals were detected using ECL Plus (GE Healthcare UK Ltd).\n\nThe expression of the SOD1 protein in lumbar spinal cord from SOD1H46R mice (13 or 22weeks of age) treated with vehicle or L-745,870 (10mg/kg) and fromnon-transgenic (non-Tg) littermates (22 weeks of age)were examined by Western blot analysis using anti-SOD1antibody.",

In the present study, we used a total of 94 mice and allocated them to the following two groups; 62 mice of 94 were used for behavior and survival analyses (survival study) and the remaining mice were for biochemical study (Fig. 1).For the survival study, a group of 62 mice, either SOD1G93A or NTG, was randomly assigned to receive a daily intraperitoneal administration with a volume of 0.3 mL of either TTM (TTM group, n=34) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS group, used as a control, n=28). TTM(Kanto Chemical Co., Tokyo) was dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4), and a fresh solution was prepared daily, since TTM was subject to be degraded to molybdate and sulfide at an acidic pH (Ogura et al.,1999). TTM at a dose of 5 mg/kg or the same volume of PBS was administered to each mouse.Treatment was started at 4 weeks of age, before the SOD1G93A mice began to exhibit ALS-like symptoms. The administration was continued until the end-point, which was defined in Clinical assessments.For the biochemical study, another group of 32 mice, either SOD1G93A or NTG, was also randomly allocated to the TTM group (n=17) or the PBS treatment group (used as a control, n=15). At the ageof 18 weeks, nearly equal to the end-stage of disease in PBS-treated SOD1G93A, the mice were killed by decapitation under light anesthesia with ether, according to the guidelines of the Ethics Committee for Laboratory Animal Use at the College of Pharmacy, Nihon University.The genotype of each mouse was identified, and the whole spinal cords which is responsible region for the disease, were dissected out and preserved at \u221280 \u00b0C for the following biochemical analyses.",

        "text": "Randomized blind analysis of edaravone administration. For the next randomized control study, we arbitrarily determinedto analyze 15 female animals per group.We crossed 8 F4 Tg male miceand 24 F4 non-Tg female mice, and generated 182 F5 offsprings. The semice were sequentially numbered before their gender and geno type had been determined. Later, we identified 45 female mSOD1 Tg mice among them. We observed their behavior for 2 months, ascertained that no mouse showed developmental or behavioral abnormality, and enrolled all of them in the study. The identification numbers of theen rolled mice were thus not sequential. The controller of the studyconfidentially assigned each mouse in numerical order into one of 3groups receiving different doses of edaravone, i.e., 0 mg/kg (vehicle),5 mg/kg, and 15 mg/kg (n=15 for each group). These doses were determined from the data obtained from the pharmacokinetic analysis. This automatic procedure of randomization thoroughly eliminated the controller's bias, and concurrently made it difficult to imagine the dose of edaravone for each mouse by its number.Moreover, littermate Tg mice, if any, were evenly assigned into different groups. The researchers who participated in this study were divided into 2 groups that remained the same throughout the study; the members o fone group were specialized for the edaravone administration; and those of the other, for behavioral observation. They were strictly blind to the information obtained by the other group members until the death of all mice.The behavioral observers visited the animal facility every day during the dark period to be with the mice during their active period and examined their motor functions, starting presymptomatically when the mice were 70 days of age. Each mouse was trained to stay ona Rotarod (Natsume Seisakusho Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) rotating at speeds of 20, 15 or 8 rpm (Li et al., 2000). The time each mouse remained on the rod was registered automatically. If a mouse persistedon the rod for 7 min within 3 repetitions, its test was completed and scored as 420 s. However, many of the mice could not remain on therod rotating at 20 rpm for 7 min during the presymptomatic period. Onthe other hand, all 45 mice could remain on the 15-rpm rotating rod for 7 min successfully within 3 trials. Therefore, the onset of the hindlimb weakness symptom in each mouse was defined to be the earliest day when multiple observers identified the manifestation of a leg tremor on 2 consecutive days when the mouse was suspended by itstail or when it failed the 15-rpm Rotarod task for 2 consecutive days.For most of the mice, the interval between those days was less than2 days.Since the onset day was determined for each mouse, the administration group members started the intraperitoneal injectionof edaravone or of the saline every day during the daytime. Thebehavioral observers examined each mouse every night, using ouroriginal motor performance score described below. Their bodyweight,the length of time they remained on the 8-rpm rotating Rotarod, andthe grip strength of their fore limbs assessed by using a Digital GripStrength Meter (Columbus Instruments, OH, USA) (Guo et al., 2003)were measured twice a week. Three repetitions were made for eachmeasurement, and the maximum was determined for each mouse.The total motor performance score consisted of 4 parts, each with acertain numerical score or points defined as follows: hind limbs: 3, noweakness; 2, one leg paresis (a leg tremor when the mouse was hanged by its tail); 1, paraparesis (both legs were weak, but stillmovable); 0, paraplegia (no leg movement). Fore limbs: 3, noweakness; 2, paresis (being able to grasp a Pull Bar but weakly); 1, plegia (being unable to grasp a Pull Bar, but able to keep its chestabove the floor); 0, unable to lift up its chest from the floor. Trunk: 1,able to twist its trunk when falling from the Rotarod; 0, unable to doso. Total body motility: 3, able to run; 2, able to walk or crawl; 1:able to right itself; 0, unable to right itself within 30 s. The score for each category was summed, and the mice with 10 points were considered to be normal clinically, whereas those with 0 points were regarded as being unable to feed themselves.The mice were sacrificed under anesthesia when they had lost the ability to right themselves within 30 s after having been placed ontheir sides.",

        "text": "Neuropathologic examination and 3-nitrotyrosine assay. In the next part of our study, to obtain neuropathologic andbiochemical evidence for significant favorable effects of edaravone onthe motor functions of the ALS mice, we treated female cohort groups with edaravone exactly as in the blind study and then sacrificed themat the 10th day after the injection of edaravone. Non-treated controlfemale mice were also sacrificed at the same time to provide age matched tissues for comparison. The time point of the 10th day waschosen, because at that time 15-mg/kg edaravone significantlypreserved the hind limb function demonstrated by the Rotarod taskin the blind study.Under deep anesthesia with diethyl ether, 3 mice each of the 3different dose groups were perfused through a cardiac cannula with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline as a fixative,and their spinal cords were processed for neuropathologic examination.As controls, 3 wild-type and 3 non-injected Tg female mice were sacrificed at the same time. Additionally, for biochemical assays, 2similarly anesthetized mice from each of the 3 treatment groups weresacrificed without fixation. Their spinal cords were immediatelydissected and stored in a deep freezer. Three unfixed spinal cords fromnon-treated wild-type mice served as controls.For quantitative neuropathologic examination, the spinal cord atthe level of L2 to L4 was sampled from each mouse, embedded inparaffin, and sectioned sequentially throughout into sections of 20-\u03bcmthickness. Approximately 60 to 100 sections of each mouse wereprocessed for Nissl staining. Neuropathologists unaware of theidentity of the sections counted the number of motoneurons in thesciatic motor pool (Lowrie et al., 1987; Kieran et al., 2004) in eachanterior horn of all sections, and the obtained numbers were averaged. In order to avoid counting the same neuron twice inconsecutive sections, only those cells in which the nucleolus wasclearly visible at higher magnification were included in the counts(Lowrie et al., 1987).The quantitative analysis of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and tyrosine inthe spinal cords was performed by using high-performance liquidchromatography with 16-electrode electrochemical detection, asdescribed in a previous report (Ferrante et al., 1997).In addition, to assess the effect of edaravone on the accumulationof 3-NT and SOD1, we rehydrated every 5th Nissl-stained sectionfrom each mouse after having counted the number of motoneurons and immunostained it with monoclonal antibody against 3-NT(1:100; Abcam plc., Cambridge, UK); and the section preceding each of these sections was also rehydrated and then stained with monoclonal anti-SOD1 antibody (1:50; NeoMarkers, CA, USA). Thenumber of \u201cdouble\u201d sections examined for each mouse varied, but 12 were the minimum number. Bound primary antibody was detected with the appropriate Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories,Burlingame, CA, USA); and 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzine tetrahydrochloridewas used as the chromogen. The total area of abnormal SOD1 deposition in each anterior horn was measured in blind fashion byneuropathologists using FvlFs image filing software (FLOVEL Co. Ltd.,Tokyo, Japan), and were averaged for each mouse. The stainingspecificity was assessed by replacing the primary antibody withphosphate-buffered saline solution containing 3% bovine serumalbumin (PBS-BSA). No deposits of reaction products were seen inthe sections thus treated.",

        "text": "Analysis of the clinical symptoms. As previously described, onset of clinical disease was determinedby the weakening of the sensori-motor ability at the rotarod test andby changes in the hind limb contraction when mice were suspendedby their tail ( Gurney et al., 1996; Kriz et al., 2002, 2003; Keller et al.,2009). A Rotarod test was used to evaluate the motor performance of the mice using an accelerating paradigm of 0.1 rpm/s. After a learning period of several days, mice were able to stay on the rotarod for up to180 s. Each mouse was given 2 trials of a maximum of 180 s and thebest performance was used as a measure for motor ability. Mice were tested once a week from age of 6 week-old until they could no longer perform the task and were sacrificed when they started to lie on the side, to express difficulties in grooming and could not right themselves within 30 s when placed on their back (Gurney et al.,1996; Kriz et al., 2002). displayed in physical units of surface radiance, photons per second per centimetre squared per steradian (photons/sec/cm2/sr). The light output was quantified by determining the total number ofphotons emitted per second using the Living Image 2.5 acquisitionand imaging software (Xenogen, Alameda, CA, USA). Region-ofinterest(ROI) measurements on the images were used to convertsurface radiance (photons/sec/cm2/sr) to source flux or total flux ofphotons expressed in photons/seconds.",

BRC was suspended in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-Na(carmellose sodium, Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) and injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 1 mg or 10 mg/5 ml/kg body weight. Inparallel, animals treated with 0.5% CMC-Na (vehicle group, 5 ml/kg) were used as controls.Two other mice groups were treated with vehicle or 10 mg/kg BRC in combination with riluzole, which was given in drinking water(100 \u03bcg/ml) ad libitum (Gurney et al., 1996). To determine the onset of motor dysfunction in transgenic mice,we adopted a balance beam test using the stainless steel bar (500 mmlong and 9 mm in diameter). We assessed motor function in the hindlimbs at 12 weeks of age, and thereafter until the mice were unable tostay on the bar. We used the following five arbitrary scales to evaluatethe motor function of mice; Grade 5 (swift walking and change of directions on bar without hind limb slipping), Grade 4 (walking butwith occasional hind limb slipping), Grade 3 (walking awkwardly with frequent hind limb slipping), Grade 2 (crawls few steps and fallsoff), and Grade 1 (unable to stay on bar). In this study, the Grade 3 was defined as the sign of the disease onset.We commenced the daily administration of the compound(s) formice that showed signs of motor dysfunction (deemed age of onset)between 121 days and 130 days, and continued until their terminal",

        "text": "Experiment 2: Salicylate measurements (in the brain and in the consumed water). In order to estimate the stability of the solution, samples were analyzed up to 1 week after the preparation of the solution. To evaluate the passage of salicylate into the brain, 14 FALS and 14 wt mice were given access to the lysine acetylsalicylate solution for 3 weeks (see Table 1 for the treatment schedule). The day before sacrifice, the animals were deprived of drinking water. Three hours before sacrifice, the animals had access to either water or lysine acetylsalicylate. It was necessary to control the period of time preceding sacrifice during which the animals had access to drug solution because brain salicylate was no longer detectable 3 h after an i.p. administration of LAS (unpublished observation). Again, intake of water or LAS solution was estimated by weighing the drink bottles before and after the 3-h period. Finally, the brains were removed and stored at 280\u00b0C until analysis. Frozen left hemispheres were sonicated in 500 \u03bcl of 0.05 M HClO4 containing 0.5 mM of EDTA (LABOSI) and 2 mM sodium metabisulfite. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted in 12 vol of HClO4-EDTA solution and 50 \u03bcl were injected onto the liquid chromatography column using a refrigerated (4\u00b0C) autoinjector Wisp 712 (Waters, Milford, MA). Separation was achieved at room temperature. The high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisted of a pump, a stainless separation column (0.46 3 7 cm) packed with an Ultrasphere XL ODS C18, 3-\u03bcm particle size (Beckman, Fullertone, CA). The mobile phase contained 0.05 M NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM octane sulfonic acid, 4% CH3CN, pH 3. The flow rate was 0.9 ml/min. The detection was carried out by means of a Coulometric detector (model 5100A; ESA, Bedford, MA) equipped with dual analytical cells set at 0.25 and 0.75 V. Concentrations of each compound were calculated using a computing integrator (Maxima, Waters) with reference calibration curves obtained after injection of standards.",

The clinical condition of micewas monitored two to three times per week according tothe procedures used by Gurney and co-workers (32; seealso 15) starting at 2 months of age. In brief, the onsetof clinical signs was scored by examining the mice for shaking limbs and/or examining the position of one orboth back legs (hanging rather than splaying out) whenthe mice were suspended in the air by their tail. Theonset of clinical disease was determined to be the age(days) at which loss of splay and/or tremors of hindlimbswere observed in the mice and occurs approximatelybetween 2 and 3 months of age for the G1H/1mice and between 6.5 and 8 months of age for theG1L/1 mice (15, 29, 32). Examining the mice for therighting reflex scored the end-stage of the disease. Themice were sacrificed if they could not right themselveswithin 30 s when placed on their sides on a flat surface.The end-stage of the disease occurs approximatelybetween 4 and 5 months of age for the G1H/1 mice andbetween 8 and 9 months of age for the G1L/1 mice (29,32). The animals were randomly numbered and assignedto the treatment groups before the clinicalcondition of the mice was examined. The neurologicalsigns for determining the onset and end-stage of diseasewere thus scored in a semiblinded manner.The motor ability of the mice was quantified bymeasuring stride length and monitored two times perweek according to the procedures used by Gurney et al.(32; see also 15). The age at which clinical weaknessdeveloped was defined as the age at which stride lengthshortening occurred. To measure stride length, micewere trained to walk in a 50-cm tube that was inclinedat one end to a height of 16 cm, darkened at one end. Torecord their tracks, hindfeet of the mice were paintedwith nontoxic, poster paints (contrasting colors), andtheir tracks were imprinted on paper (labeled with onlythe number of the animal and date) lining the floor ofthe tube. Stride length was measured manually andwas defined as the distance between successive right-torightand left-to-left footprints. As the disease progresses,the painted footprints became increasinglysmeared on the paper, which correlated with previousresults (52). The onset of clinical weakness was quantifiedby determining the age at which shortening of thestride length occurred. Because only the number of therandomized animal and date identified the recordedtracks, the measurement of stride length was determinedin a blinded manner. In addition, the bodyweights of the animals were measured two times perweek, as weight loss is a symptom of near end-stageFALS (15, 32).",

Five fields were selected in each cover glass using always the same acquisition parameters (laser intensity, photomultiplier gain, pinhole aperture,electronic zoom) for all the images. Changes in 3-NT and nNOS immunoreactivity (IR ) were measured through densitometric analyses, using the ImageJ software (version1.41, National Institutes of Health, USA).

Stock HEt (1 mg/mL) was prepared as previously described (Sensiet al., 1999) in dry DMSO and stored in frozen aliquots for use within eight weeks.Cultures were loaded in the dark with 1 mM HEt in HCSS (45 min, 25  C). Afterloading, cultures were washed (4 times) in a static bath of HCSS containing 1 mMHEt.Cells were excited at 560 nm and fluorescence emission was collected at 590 nm. To compensate for cell-to-cell variability in dye loading, after background subtraction from a cell-free region of the dish, HEt fluorescence measurements for each cell (Fx)were normalized to the fluorescence intensity for that cell at the beginning of the experiment (F0).Drugs were applied by bath application and removed through a rapid flow exchange system.

Electromyography (EMG)wasmeasured using a Nicolet Viking IV (Nicolet, Charles,Missouri, USA)EMG recorder according the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (10 ml/kg, intraperitoneal injection, i.p.)and normal body temperature was maintained with a heating lamp. Compound muscle amplitude potential (CMAP) was measured by inserting a ground needle electrode (Nicolet Fp581) on the back of the mouse, an anode needle at the base of the tail, and a reference needle electrode near the Achille\u2019s tendon.When the sciatic nerve was given a stimulus at a paraspinal site using a 0.2-ms/1-Hz supra-maximal single pulse through a needle electrode (Nicolet Fp581), the evoked amplitude of the CMAPwas recorded fromthemedial part of the gastrocnemius muscle with a unipolar needle electrode. Once the recording was validated by an initial negative deflection and biphasic waveform, a series of stimuli with gradually increased intensity were applied to assess the supra-maximal stimulus. After the intensity of stimulation was saturated,the peak-to-peak amplitude of CMAP was recorded.A modified statistical method of motor unit number estimation (MUNE) was performed as previously described (Shefner et al., 2007). Briefly, once a CMAP was measured through supra-maximal stimulation, a stimulus-response curve was obtainedby delivering 30 computer-controlled stimuli with gradually increased intensity.Any peak over 10% of the total CMAP was investigated to determine the responseof a single large-amplitude motor unit. Four response ranges were chosen and were:10%e20%, 25%e35%, 40%e50% and 55e65% of maximal response. The weightedaveragemethod was used to calculated average single motor unit potential (SMUP).A MUNE was obtained from [CMAP]/[SMUP].\n\nEffect of DL-NBP treatment on electromyographical parameters.",

        "text": "2.7. Patch clamp recordings. Experiments were performed in acute transverse hippocampal slicestaken from pre-symptomatic and symptomatic SOD1G93A mice and agematchedWT mice.Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane before decapitation.Transverse slices (300 \u03bcm thick) were obtained with a vibratome(VT1000 S; Leica, Nussloch, Germany) in ice cold dissecting solutioncontaining (in mM) 110 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2, 25NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, and 7 D-glucose, oxygenated with 95% O2and 5% CO2, pH 7.4. Slices were incubated in aCSF solution (composition:124 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3,1 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) at 35 \u00b0C for30 min and then maintained at room temperature for at least 60 mincontinuously gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. After the recoveryperiod, each slice was transferred to a recording chamber, continuouslysuperfused with aCSF solution at 3 mL/min at room temperature forrecording.Visually guided whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performedfrom CA1 neurons using a Carl Zeiss Axioskop 2FS uprightmicroscope (Jena, Germany) equipped with a differential interferencecontrast-infrared (DIC-IR) CCD video camera (VX44, Till Photonics,Gr\u00e4felfing, Germany) and recorded with an Axopatch 200B (AxonInstruments, Foster City, CA, USA) amplifier. Patch pipettes (4\u20139 M\u03a9)were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5 mm outer diameter,0.86 mm inner diameter, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) withPC-10 Puller (Narishige Group, London, UK) and filled with an internalsolution containing (in mM): 125 CsCl, 8 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 10HEPES, 10 glucose, 5 Mg ATP, and 0.4 NaGTP, pH 7.2, adjusted withCsOH (50 wt% in H2O), 280\u2013290 mOsm; for EPSCAMPA recordings,0.1 mM spermine was added.All recordings were performed in the continuous presence of picrotoxin(50 \u03bcM) to block GABAergic transmission. Stimuli (0.2 msrectangular pulses every 15 s) were delivered via monopolar stimulationwith a patch-type pipette filled with aCSF and positioned in stratumradiatum. NMDA/AMPA ratios were calculated to check for changes inAMPA or NMDA currents and were obtained from experiments whereEPSCs at Vh = \u221270mV and Vh = +40 mV were alternately recorded.Peak current amplitude recorded at Vh = \u221270mV was taken as anestimate of AMPAR activation. Since currents at Vh = +40 mV arecomposed of AMPA and NMDA currents, NMDA currents were notmeasured at peak but at 60 ms after AMPA peak at Vh = \u221270 mV,where AMPA currents are already negligible.EPSCNMDA and EPSCAMPA were recorded in another set of experimentswhere currents were pharmacologically isolated by adding to theaCSF supplemented with picrotoxin (50 \u03bcM), CNQX (25 \u03bcM) or APV(50 \u03bcM), respectively. Current/voltage relationships (I/V plots) wereobtained from experiments where Vh was alternated from \u221270mV to+50 mV (EPSCAMPA) or \u221290mV to +50 mV (EPSCNMDA) with gaps of10 mV in-between steps. To allow data pooling from different experiments,EPSCs amplitudes were normalized in each experiment bytaking as 1 the peak amplitude recorded at \u221270 mV (EPSCAMPA) or+50 mV (EPSCNMDA). The rectification index (EPSC+50/EPSC-70mV)for either EPSCNMDA or EPSCAMPA currents was calculated by the ratioof peak EPSPs amplitudes recorded at a Vh = +50 mV over the peakcurrent amplitude recorded at Vh = \u221270mV.Acquired signals were filtered using an in-built, 2-kHz, 3-pole Besselfilter, and data were digitized at 10 kHz under control of the pCLAMP11 (Molecular Devices, San Jos\u00e9, CA, USA) software program. Offsetpotentials were nulled before giga-seal formation. Small voltage steps(\u22125 mV, 50 ms) were used to monitor the access resistance throughoutrecording and experiments in which this parameter varied by more than20% were discarded.",

For membrane revelation, we used a chemiluminescent detection method with the Amersham-ECL kit (GE Healthcare\u2122, Chicago, IL, USA), and immunoreactivity was visualized using a Chemidoc XRS + system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Western blot densitometry was determined with Image J 1.52a software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) and normalized based on band intensity to GAPDH(housekeeping gene).The A2AR antibody was validated against a positive control (WTmouse striatum) and a negative control (A2AR Knock out (A2AR KO) mouse striatum). The amount of total protein loaded for the both striatum, WT and A2AR KO, was 25 \u03bcg (Figure Supplementary Fig. 3).For comparison of pre-symptomatic SOD1G39A and age-matched WTmice, whole hippocampi were used to prepare homogenates. In symptomatic and age-matched WT mice, due to hippo campal slice preparationfor fEPSP recordings, we used excess slices for Western Blot.",

The disease endpoints were derived by blind clinical observation and by various rotarod parameters.Onset of the disease was defined as the age in days when tremor appeared in both hind limbs, together with the inability of the mouse to extend and paddle at least one hind paw, when suspendedin the air by its tail. This test was performed 3 times a week from day 70 onwards. Survival was defined as the age in days when mice could no longer ride themselves when gently prodded for approximately 10 s and/or the appearance of severe eye infection.Disease duration was defined as the time between disease onset and survival.The rotarod performance test was done using a Rotarod (ColumbusInstruments, Columbus, OH), which has a rotating rod starting with a speed 20 rpm and accelerated 1 rpm every 10 s. The rotarod performance test measured the time it took for each mouse to fall off the rotarod. The rotarod test was used to obtain two endpoints:rotarod onset defined as the age in days after which the mouse fell consistently below 80% of average performance and rotarod survival as the age in days after which the mouse fell consistently below 20% of average performance.",

        "text": "Treatment, for the onset of clinical signs (abnormal splaying of the hind limbs when suspended by the tail; Gurney, 1997; Gurney et al., 1996). The animals were killed at 199 days of age. Low copy number G93A SOD1 mice develop signs of disease at 6\u20137 months and die 4\u20136 weeks later. We therefore selected 199 days as an age when many animals would be expected to show signs of disease, yet none to have died. Since survival was predefined and not an experimental end point, we developed a six-point clinical scale to gauge the severity of disease at the age of killing. In this scale, a score of 0 was given to mice showing no evidence of disease, 1 to those showing first evidence of disease (as above), 2 showing first evidence of paresis in the hind limbs, and then progressively until 6 with complete paralysis of the hind limbs. The scale proved simple to use in practice, and all scoring was undertaken by a single examiner. At the age of killing, all animals were still able to access cage floor-level food and water, and able to right themselves within 30 s after being placed on their side, which we and others have accepted previously as reasons for killing. Since estrogen was expected to provide neuroprotective effects (Xu et al., 1996), we also investigated the effects of gender on the onset and severity of clinical signs in male and female mice, irrespective of treatment. All animals were killed with carbon dioxide at 199 days of age and parts of the CNS (cerebral hemisphere and spinal cord: T2 to L1 section) and certain skeletal muscles (extensor digitorum longus [EDL] and medial gastrocnemius) were immediately excised and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical analysis. Lumbar portions of the spinal cord (L2\u2013sacral region) were immersed and fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for subsequent histopathological analysis (Paraffin embedded). Lumbar regions were sectioned (3  m) on a microtome and stained with Cresyl Violet. The L3 region was chosen for neuron counting to ensure clean sections distal to the cut at L2 for removal of the cord segment. Magnified digital images ( 200) were obtained for each section. The total number of neurons in each ventral horn, as well as the number of medium- (15\u201325  m) and large-diameter ( 25  m) neurons were determined on two separate occasions using ImagePro software. We also calculated the mean number of neurons per unit of anterior horn area. All cells that were within the ventral horn anterior to a line across the spinal cord touching the anterior part of the central canal were counted and the mean of the right and left side was reported. These data were all analyzed by the same experimenter blinded to the treatments. The average test\u2013retest coefficient of variation for counting the total number of neurons in the spinal cord sections across all of the data in the experiment was 16.5%.",

Following 7 days of treatment with CAPE or vehicle, mice were anesthetized by isofluorane inhalation and perfusion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Spinal cords were removed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at4 \u00b0C, and prepared for paraffin embedding. Samples were serially sectioned (15  m) through the enlargement of the lumbar spinalcord and immuno stained with mouse monoclonal primary antibodyagainst microtubule-associated protein 2 (1:1000, MAP2;Millipore), mouse monoclonal antibody against glial fibrillary acidicprotein (1:1000, GFAP; Millipore), or rabbit polyclonal antibodyagainst ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (1:500, Iba-1;Wako Chemicals USA Inc., Richmond, VA, USA; Ito et al., 2001;Sasaki et al., 2001; Voskuhl et al., 2009) followed by incubationwith biotinylated secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.). Visualization of the immunoreactions was performed using an avidin-biotin complex kit (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA,USA) with 3,3=-diaminobenzene tetrahydrochloride dehydrate asthe chromogen (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.). Immuno histochemical negative control sections were treated with the same protocol except for incubation with primary antibody, and no specific staining was seen. Sections used for motor neuron counting were first observedfor defined MAP2-immunoreactive neuronal processesthen counterstained using Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin (Sigma-AldrichCorp.) before mounting. Large motor neurons were counted in the ventral horn of lumbar spinal cord by using a light microscope withan  40 objective (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY, USA) and were identified by a basophilic cellular outline (containing Nissl substance)and a prominent nucleolus (Grossman et al., 2001; Sato et al.,2003). A total of 6\u20138 sections per animal through the lumbar area of the spinal cord were counted and reported as number of motorneurons per section as previously described (Dodge et al., 2008).For sections immunostained with Iba-1, as described previously(Ito et al., 2001; Sasaki et al., 2001; Voskuhl et al., 2009), activated microglia were characterized by a rounded cell body withshort processes versus a resting or \u201cramified\u201d morphology.",

        "text": "Cell culture and transfection. A hybrid immortalized motor neuron cell line, NSC34, was selected for these studies because the cells retain proliferative ability in culture and express several motor neuron features (Cashman et al., 1992). NSC34 cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 lg/mL streptomycin at 37  C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The expression plasmids GFP-wtSOD1 and GFP-G93A-SOD1 were kindly provided by Prof. Angelo Poletti (Universita` degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy). Transfection was carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Corporation) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The cells were incubated with DNA-Lipofectamine  2000 complexes for 4\u20136 h, after which growth medium was replaced. To examine the effect of trehalose on mutant SOD1, trehalose was added to the growth medium of NSC34 cells that had been transiently transfected with G93ASOD1 or wtSOD1. After 24 h transfection, 100 mM trehalose was added to the growth medium of NSC34 cells transiently transfected with G93ASOD1 or wtSOD1 for 24 h treatment. The effects of trehalose on the expression of mutant SOD1 in NSC34 cells were analyzed by Western blot. Additionally, the levels of the autophagy markers LC3-II and p62 (Klionsky et al., 2007) were also measured by Western blot.",

All transgenic mice in the survival/end-stage experiment were assessed three times per week starting at 60 days of age and given neurological scores by an investigator who was blind to the treatment. The neurological scorescale was 0\u20134, as developed by ALSTDI (ALS TherapyDevelopment Institute) (Scott et al., 2008; Gill et al.,2009; Lincecum et al., 2010). The criteria used to assign each score were as follows: (0) full extension of the hindlegs away from the lateral midline when the mouse is suspended by its tail, the mouse can hold this position for two seconds at a time when suspended two to three times; (1)collapse or partial collapse of leg extension toward the lateral midline (weakness) or trembling of the hind legs during tail suspension; (2) toes curl under at least twice during a 12-inch walk, or any part of the foot is dragged along the cage bottom/table; (3) rigid paralysis or minimaljoint movement, the foot is not being used for forward motion; and (4) the mouse cannot right itself within 30 s,from either side.Disease onset was defined as the date when the mouse was first assessed with a neurological score of1. Once a score of 3 was reached, the mouse was tested twice daily until death to ensure that the date of death was accurately determined. For humane reasons,all mice were immediately euthanized by cervical dislocation once they reached a neurological score of 4.Thus, for the purposes of this study, death was definedas the mouse reaching a neurological score of 4 duringthe survival experiment. The date and cause of deathwere recorded for each mouse. End stage was also defined by the date when the mouse reached a neurological score of 4.",

        "text": "Body weight assessment. Body weight can be an indicator of malaise arising from chronic drug treatment or disease-related motor impairment. Weight-loss in high copy SOD1-G93A miceis normally a gradual process, begins at approximately 90 days of age and continues until death. Rapid weight-loss over a short number of days does not fit the normal pattern and is, therefore, indicative of non-ALSrelated or drug-induced maladies (Scott et al., 2008).The initial body weight was measured when mice were 60 days of age, and subsequent body weight measurements were recorded for each mouse three times per week starting at 70 days of age. Weighing was always performed between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. to avoid diurnal variations in weight.",

        "text": "Motor function tests. Motor function was evaluated in SOD1-G93A transgenic mice by means of a rotarod performance test and a hanging wire test. The rotarod test measures the time a mouse can maintain their balance on a rotating cylinder.Starting at 77 days of age, mice were placed on a horizontal rod and the rod was made to rotate until themice fell off. The speed of rotation started at 1 rpm andthe rotation speed was increased to 30 rpm within 80 s.After an adaptation period of 5\u20137 days of daily practice on the rotarod, the frequency of the test was reduced to twice per week. Each mouse was given three attempts,and the longest time each mouse remained on the rodwas recorded. For comparison of the performancebetween the two groups, 180 s was chosen as the arbitrary maximum cut-off time (Knippenberg et al.,2010). In the hanging wire test, the mice were placed on a wired housing cage lid. The lid was gently shaken to prompt the mouse to grasp the wire grid, and then the lid was swiftly inverted. The time from lid inversion until the mouse released the lid with both hind limbs was measured.Each mouse was given up to three attempts to holdon to the inverted lid for an arbitrary maximum of 90 s, andthe longest time that was achieved was recorded for eachmouse (Weydt et al., 2003).",

The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4  C in a microcentrifugeand the supernatant was removed for Western blotting.A BCA (BCA Protein Assay Kit, Pierce Biotechnology,Rockford, Illinois, USA) assay was performed to determine the protein concentration of each sample. An equal amount of protein (40 lg) from each sample was electrophoresed on 10% or 13% SDS\u2013PAGE gels and transferred onto 0.45-lm PVDF membranes(Immobilon-P, Millipore Bedford, MA, USA). After protein transfer, the membranes were blocked with 5% non-fatmilk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at roomtemperature.

Five mice from each group were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde fixative in 0.1 M phosphatebuffer (pH 7.4) under deep anesthesia (10% chloralhydrate, 0.2 ml/mouse, intraperitoneally) at 90 days ofage or at the end stage in the preliminary and survivalexperiments, respectively. Spinal cords were dissected and the lumbar segments (L 3\u20135) were post-fixed in the same fixative solution at 4  C for 24 h. The fixed lumbar segments were then cut into 20-lm sections using aVibratome Microtome (Leica VT 1000S, LeicaBiosystems, Nussloch, Germany). The sections were washed three times in PBS and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. After blocking with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min and 10% horse serum for 1 h at room temperature, antibodies against neuron-specificnuclear protein (NeuN; 1:500, Millipore, Bedford, MA,USA) were applied to some tissue sections overnight at4  C. The sections were subsequently incubated withbiotinylated anti-mouse IgG (1:200, ZSGB-BIO, Beijing,China) for 2 h at room temperature, followed byincubation with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:200,ZSGB-BIO, China) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally,sections were treated with 0.03% diaminobenzidine as achromogen for 10 min. The sections were visualized and photographed with an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a DP72 digital camera system (Olympus,Tokyo, Japan).To assess whether trehalose treatment exerted an effect on glial activation in the spinal cord of ALS mice,we used a rabbit anti-Iba1 antibody (1:500, Wako,Richmond, VA, USA), a marker for activated microglia,and a mouse anti-GFAP monoclonal IgG antibody(1:200, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), a specific markerfor astrocytes. Microglial and astrocytic activation was assessed in the spinal cords of trehalose-treated or untreated transgenic mice at 90 days and at end stageof the disease. Immunoreactivity was visualized by incubating sections for 1 h at room temperature withfluorescent secondary antibodies (FITC conjugate ofgoat anti-rabbit or Cy5 conjugate of goat anti-mouseIgG, 1:500, ZSGB-BIO). Negative controls wereperformed by incubating sections with primary orsecondary antibodies only. All sections were examinedusing a confocal laser scanning biological microscope(FV1000, Olympus).",

The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk at room temperature for 1 h, then incubated overnight at 4  C with the following primary antibodies: Notch1 (1:1000,Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), Jagged1(1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), Hey1 (1:1000,Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), Maml1 (1:1000, CellSignaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), Hes1(1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), b-actin (1:1000,Zhongshan Jinqiao Biotechnology, Beijing, China), Bcl2(1:1000, Zhongshan Jinqiao Biotechnology, Beijing,China), Bax (1:1000, Zhongshan Jinqiao Biotechnology,Beijing, China), and cytochrome c (1:1000, ZhongshanJinqiao Biotechnology, Beijing, China). The membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (1:10,000,Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA, USA)conjugated with IRDye800DX fluorescence at room temperature for 2 h. The membranes were rinsed for 10 min   3 with 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-bufferedsaline (PBS) after incubation with each antibody. The protein bands were imaged on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-COR Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE,USA) and quantified with NIH Image J software.\n\nThe mRNA and protein levels of Notch1, Jagged1 and Hey1 were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blotting.",

Cells were grown in six-well plates, treated, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested.Spinal cord tissues from the control and experimental groups of mice at 130 days were dissected and homogenized in RIPA buffer (Beyotime, China)containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) for 30min, followed by centrifugation at 13,000g for 15 min.For the SDS\u2013PAGE analysis of flies, heads of 28-day old flies were removed with a sharp scalpel blade and homogenized in cold lysis buffer as previously described(Maher et al., 2011), and nonionic detergent-soluble and insoluble extractions from cells and flies were separated as described previously (Karch and Borchelt, 2008). Protein samples containing equal amounts were separated by SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters(Merck Millipore Ltd., USA). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk followed by the following primary antibodies:rabbit anti-p-ERK1/2 (No. 9101, 1/1000) and rabbitanti-ERK1/2 (No. 4695, 1/1000) from Cell Signaling Technology and mouse anti-HO1 (ab13248, 1:250), rabbitanti-hSOD1 (ab79390, 1:10,000), and rabbit anti-b-tubulin(ab179513, 1:1000) from Abcam. After the membranes were washed with PBST, secondary antibodies from Li-COR Biotechnology were used (1:10,000). Membranes were scanned using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System(Li-COR Biotechnology). The intensities of the protein bands were quantified using ImageJ software.",

The sequences were as follows: rat NQO1ARE sense, 50-ctagcTCAGAGATTTCAGTCTAGAGTCACAGTGACTTGGCAAAATCa-30, and antisense, 50-gatctGATTTTGCCAAGTCACTGTGACTCTAGACTGAAATCTCTGAg-30, and rat NQO1 mutated ARE sense,50-ctagcTCAGAGATTTCAGTCTAGAGTCACAGTGACTTGATAAAATCa-30,and antisense, 50-gatctGATTTTATCAAGTCACTGTGACTCTAGACTGAAATCTCTGAg-30. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealedand cloned into the NheI and BglII sites of the pGL4.24[luc2P/minP]vector (Promega), which contains the synthetic firefly luc2 driven by a minimal promoter, resulting in pGL4-ARE and pGL4-mARE, respectively. SH-SY5Y cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 104 cells perwell in 96-well plates. After 24 h incubation, the cells were transfected for 24 h with 0.2 mg of the firefly luciferase reporter emptypGL4.24[luc2P/minP] vector, pGL4-ARE, or pGL4-mARE and 0.05 mgof the Renilla luciferase control reporter pRL-thymidine kinase promoter vector (Promega) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were then treated with 40 mM CPN-9 for another 8 h. The Nrf2 activator tBHQ was used as a positive control. Luciferase activities inthe cell extracts were determined with the Dual-Glo luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) using a multilabel reader (ModelARVO x3; PerkinElmer). The luciferase activities were normalized tothe Renilla luciferase activity of the internal control, and activity was expressed as fold induction after treatment with compounds compared with vehicle control (DMSO).",

To determine the effect of microglial cells overexpressing wild type or mutant SOD1 on the survival or death of CGNs, co-culture nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (2 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at room temperature. Stained cultures were photographed with a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE 2000-S; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an AxioCam MRm (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) digital camera and nuclei were counted in 5 random fields from each Petri dish by using Fiji ImageJ2 software (NIH). Neuronal survival was evaluated by counting normal, uncondensed nuclei (size range 4.2\u20134.8 \u03bcm) as previously described [46]. Under these staining conditions (5-minute incubation),Hoechst 33258 does not stain microglial nuclei, which usually require at least 20 min of incubation, while CGNs nuclei are stained. Occasionally stained glial nuclei can be excluded from counting because they are oval (CGNs nuclei are round) and considerably larger[47].",

        "text": "2.15. High performance liquid chromatography. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify the release of glutamate and serine in conditioned media fromtransfected microglial cells exploiting liquid-liquid partition chromatography in reverse phase. A Beckman Coulter Ultrasphere ODS column packed with the stationary phase formed by 5 \u03bcm diameter particles was used. Twenty microliters of each medium were introduced into the flow. The detector (Varian 9070) can reveal glutamate and serine coming out (eluate) from the column. To measure the amount of glutamate and serine, a standard solution of serine and glutamate(concentrations between 0.625 \u03bcM and 20 \u03bcM) was used.",

        "text": "Minocycline Treatment Protocol. The SOD1G37R mice were housed at the standard temperature (21\u00b0C) and in light controlled environment with ad libitum access to the food and water. The study was carried out using groups of transgenic littermates derived from the breeding of heterozygous SOD1G37R mice. The mouse littermates were fed a regular rodent food (Harlan, Teklad) and were randomly divided into minocycline-treated and control groups, including wild type littermates. To avoid any potential interference with the minocycline antibacterial effects, mice were kept in pathogen free facility. At the age of 7 or 9 months, SOD1G37R mice from the experimental groups were administered minocycline in the diet. Minocycline (Sigma, Canada) was delivered in the special Custom Made Rodent Diet (Harlan, Teklad) at a concentration of 1 g/kg. For the control groups the regular diet was continued until the mice reached end-stage disease. When progression of muscle weakness became marked, mice were fed at the bottom of their cages together with specially designed containers allowing them permanent access to water. Onset of the clinical disease was determined by measurement of motor strength test, as described below (Kong et al., 1998) and by the hind limb contraction when mice were suspended by their tail. At the end-stage disease, the mice were monitored daily. They were killed when they started to lie on the side in their cages and when they start to express difficulties in grooming, as described previously (Gurney et al., 1996). To confirm the effects of minocycline, two independent experiments were carried out at six-month interval with different sets of trangenic SOD1G37R mice. Similar results were obtained in both cases.",

With minor adjustments, muscle strength test wasconducted as previously described (Kong et al., 1998).The mice were allowed to grab vertically oriented wire( 2 mm in diameter) with the loop at the lower end.The wire was designed in such a way that it allowed the mice to use both fore- and hindlimbs. For more consistent measurements, the wire was maintained inthe vertically oriented circular motion (circle radius 15 cm at 35 r.p.m.). Three tests (three consecutivedays) were first used as a learning period trial in which all the mice learned to use both fore and hindlimbs in order to stay longer on the circulating wire.Therefore, both skeletal muscle groups contribute inthis strength assay. The maximum performance time was cut to 3 min. After the learning period, the test was performed once a week.",

From one hindlimb, m. soleus and m. extens or digitorum longus (EDL) were carefully dissected and incubated for 15 min in organ baths containing Krebs-Henseleitsolution (118 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM KCL,1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM KH2PO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 1 mMglucose) which was continuously gassed with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and maintained at 25\u00b0C. Thereafter,these muscles (not subjected to contractions) were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at  80\u00b0C for later biochemical assays. Soleus and EDL muscles from the contralateral hindlimb were dissected and wires were attached to the tendons and mounted vertically in an incubation bath with one tendon attached to a force transducer and stimulated with capacitor discharges of alternating polarity.After mounting, a 15-min stabilization period was allowedand optimal muscle length (L0) was determined. In order to evaluate twitch and tetanic characteristics, soleus and EDL muscles were electrically stimulated 5 times at 1 Hz, interspersed with 1-min rest intervals (twitch stimulation), and three times for 700 ms at 100 Hz (EDL) and 500 ms at 50Hz(Sol) with 4-min rest intervals (tetanic stimulation). The average maximal specific tension (  force corrected forcross-sectional area), Max dF/dt (maximal rate of forcedevelopment) and Min dF/dt (maximal rate of relaxation)were calculated for the twitch and tetanic contractions.Cross-sectional area was determined by dividing the wet muscle mass by the product of muscle length (L0) and 1.06g/cm3, the density of mammalian skeletal muscle. The fatigability was evaluated as the decrease in tetanic tension during six consecutive 2-min bouts of repeated tetani (350ms) with decreasing rest-intervals (3.8, 3.1, 2.6, 2.1, 1.6,and 1.3 s). Recovery was evaluated by a single tetanus delivered 5 and 10 min into recovery following cessation ofthe fatigue protocol.",

The sciatic nerve was stimulated percutaneously by means of single pulses of 0.02 ms duration (GrassS88) delivered through a pair of needle electrodes placed atthe sciatic notch. The compound muscle action potential(CMAP, M wave) was recorded from the tibialis anterior(TA) and the plantar (interossei) muscles with microneedle electrodes [27, 28]. For evaluation of the motor central pathways,motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from theTA and plantar muscles in response to transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor cortex by single rectangular pulses of 0.1 ms duration, delivered through needle electrodes inserted subcutaneously, the cathode over the skull overlaying the sensorimotor cortex and the anode at the nose [27, 29]. Allpotentials were amplified and displayed on a digital oscilloscope(Tektronix 450S) at settings appropriate to measure theamplitude from baseline to the maximal negative peak. To ensure reproducibility, the recording needles were placed undermicroscope to secure the same placement on all animals guided by anatomical landmarks. During the tests, the mice body temperature was kept constant by means of a thermostated heating pad.",

Clinical disease onset was defined as the first day when an animal was not able to complete the 180 seconds on the rotating rod.The DigiGait system (Mouse Specifics, Boston, MA) was used to assess the locomotor performance of the animals at theend stage of the disease (16 weeks of age). The animals were placed over the treadmill belt and their capacity to run withincreasing treadmill velocity was recorded.

At 16 weeks of age, 4\u20135 mice from each group were transcardially perfused with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS and the lumbar segment of the spinal cord was harvested,post-fixed for 24 h, and cryopreserved in 30 % sucrose.Transverse 40-\u03bcm thick sections were serially cut with acryotome (Leica) between L2\u2013L5 segmental levels. For each segment, each section of a series of ten was collected sequentially on separate gelatin-coated slides or free-floating in Olmos medium.One slide of each animal was rehydrated for 1 min and stained for 2 h with an acidified solution of 3.1 mM cresylviolet. Then, the slides were washed in distilled water for1 min, dehydrated and mounted with DPX (Fluka).MNs were identified by their localization in the ventral horn of the spinalcord sections and counted following strict size and morphological criteria; only MNs with diameters larger than 20 \u03bcm,polygonal shape and prominent nucleoli were counted. The number of MNs present in both ventral horns was counted infour serial sections of each L4 and L5 segments [27, 34].Another series of sections was blocked with PBS-Triton-FBS and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with primary antibodies anti-glial fibrilary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:1000, Dako), rabbit anti-ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1,1:1000, Wako), or anti-sirtuin 1 (Sirt1, 1:200, Abcam). Afterseveral washes, sections were incubated for 1 hour at roomtemperature with Alexa 488 or Alexa 594-conjugated secondaryantibody (1:200; Life Science), or, for anti-Sirt antibody,with biotinilated secondary antibody (1:200, Vector) and thenfor 1 hour with Alexa 594-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000,Vector). For co-localizations, spinal MNs were labeled with435/455-Neurotrace fluorescent Nissl staining (1:200, LifeScience). To quantify astroglial and microglial immunoreactivity,microphotographs of the ventral horn grey matter were taken at\u00d7400 and, after defining the threshold for backgroundcorrection, the integrated density of GFAP or Iba1 labelingwas measured using ImageJ software [33].

        "text": "Motor Function Testing. Motor function and coordination were tested using an accelerated rotarod device (Columbus Instruments, Columbus,OH,USA). At 15 weeks of age, mice were trained for 2 days to become acquainted with the rotarod. In the training sessions  a fixed speed protocol (20 rpm) with a cut off of 180 s was applied. The testing began at 16 weeks of age using a ramped accelerating program: the animals were positioned on the rotating bar, time was started, and the rod was accelerated at a constant rate from 8 rpm to 32 rpm for a maximum of 180 s.Mice were given 3 consecutive trials (10 min intervals), and for each animal the longest latency to fall was recorded as a measure of the motor function competence. Rotarod testing was performed once a week until the animals reached the preestablished minimum performance (5 s).",

Urea lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 \u00d7g for 20 minat 4 \u00b0C and the supernatants collected as insoluble fraction.Fifteen micrograms of proteins was loaded and resolved in12% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE gel and transferred on PVDFmembranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). After transfer,membranes were stained by Ponceau (Sigma) for total transferred proteinevaluation. Western blot was performed by blocking in 3%BSA (bovine serum albumin, Biobasic Canada) prepared inTBS-tween 1% (VWR Lifescience). Proteins of interest weredetected by incubating the membrane overnight in blocking buffer with primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-hTDP-43(1:1000, Abnova) and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP (1:5000, glialfibrillary acidic protein, DAKO). Finally, membranes were incubated with respective horse radish peroxidase secondary antibodies 1:5000 in blocking buffer, and chemiluminescence was revealed by ECL reagent (electrogenerated chemiluminescence,Thermo Fisher Scientific) on light films (Kodak).Immunoreactivity was quantified by Image Lab software(Biorad) and normalized on Ponceau signals.",

        "text": "Respirometry Studies. After chronic DCA or vehicle treatment, glial monolayers were scraped and resuspended at 2 \u00d7 106 cells/ml concentration in culture medium. Then, cell respiration was evaluated using the Oxygraph 2 K respirometer (Oroboros InstrumentsCorp). Oxygen consumption was recorded at 37 \u00b0C in non permeabilized intact cells. The rate of oxygen consumption(OCR or O2 flux) was calculated by the equipment software(DataLab) and was expressed as picomoles of oxygenper milliliter per second.During recording, basal oxygen consumption (basalOCR) stabilization was followed by sequential additionof 1) the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin (oligo,2 \u03bcg/ml), to obtain ATP production related-OCR, 2) successive steps of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide ptrifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone(FCCP, 0.5 \u03bcM each)until maximal respiratory capacity OCR levels was reached, and 3) the mitochondrial complex III inhibitorantimycin A (AA, 2.5 \u03bcM) to obtain the nonmitochondrial OCR. AA-inhibited OCR was subtracted from other values to obtain the mitochondrial oligo-inhibited OCR related to ATP synthesis (oligo-inhibited flux\u2013AA-inhibited flux)and the maximal mitochondrial respiratory capacity OCR(maximum FCCP-uncoupled flux\u2013AA-inhibited flux,MRR). Spare respiratory capacity (SRC) was obtained by subtracting basal OCR from MRR. Mitochondrial function was then expressed as the respiratory control ratio (RCR)index of the intact cells, calculated as the ratio: mitochondrial oligo-inhibited OCR/maximal mitochondrial respiratorycapacity OCR. The cell RCR index has the same 2main advantages as coupling efficiency, which are sensitivity to several potential sites of dysfunction and internal normalization. It is a good marker of mitochondrial dysfunctionin cells, as it depends on almost every functional aspect of OXPHOS [26, 27]. Graphical explanation of calculated parameters is shown in the BResults^ section(Fig. 2a).",

DCA was made fresh at a 500-mg/l concentration in tapwater twice a week, and the total consumed volume was measured to ensure a constant daily dose of 100 mg/kg(based on a daily intake of 50 ml) as previously reported for mice [5, 28]. Female rats were used for the experiment.All rats were weighed, and motor activity was observedtwice/week from 90 to 100 days of age. Disease onset was determined for each animal when pronounced muscleatrophy was accompanied by abnormal gait, typically expressed as subtle limping or dragging of 1 hind limb.In this moment, animals were randomly assigned to controlor DCA treatment group (n = 5 per group). Body weight was 286 \u00b1 7.8 in control and 279 \u00b1 10.8 g in DCA group atthe start of treatment (t8 = 0.538; p = 0.606), and there were no differences after 10 days (276 \u00b1 3.6 in control and 274\u00b1 11.0 g in DCA group; t8 = 0.128; p = 0.902). Five age matched(\u00b1 5 days; body weight 312 \u00b1 11.0 g) control nTganimals were also included. After 10 days of treatment,animals were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneally ketamine/xylazine overdose (90 and 10 mg/kg respectively)and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline and 4%PFA in 0.1 M DPBS, pH 7.4. Lumbar spinal cord was removed, postfixed by immersion for 24 h, and then transverse sectioned (30 \u03bcm) in a Leica cryostat. Free-floating immunolabeling was performed. Sections were permeabilized for 30 min (0.3% Triton X-100 in DPBS); blocked with 10% goat serum, 2% BSA, and 0.3% Triton X-100 for1 h; and incubated overnight or 48 h in primary antibodies for NeuN, Iba1, GFAP, S100\u03b2, or GFAP plus S100\u03b2, dilutedin 0.3% Triton X-100 PBS. After washing, sections were incubated in appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 Dyes.

Mice were then perfused with saline solution followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich,St. Louis, MO, USA) solution (freshly prepared with pH 7.4phosphate buffer). Spinal cords were extracted and fixationwas continued by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde madein pH 7.4 phosphate buffer overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The next day,samples were cryopreserved in 30% sucrose (made in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer) for 48 h. After this time, tissue was encasedin a cubic recipient (Peel-A-Way Disposable EmbeddingMolds-S-22, Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA), and embeddedin tissue-freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical SciencesInc., Newcastle, UK) and frozen (\u2212 80 \u00b0C). The lumbar spinalcord was then cut at a 16-\u03bcm section depth and resulting seeded on a gelatin-coated slide. In the case of organotypicslices, these were directly seeded onto the slides. Sampleswere permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 PBS for 30 minand blocked with 5% normal horse serum in 0.4% Triton X-100 PBS (blocking solution) for 2 h at room temperature.Primary antibody (diluted according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions)incubation, anti-8-oxo-dG (ab62623, Abcam,Cambridge, UK), anti-\u03b3H2Ax (ab2893, Abcam), anti-GFAP(ab7260, Abcam) anti-Iba1 (ab5076, Abcam), and anti-SMI-32 (Covance, Princeton, NJ), was performed in blocking solutionovernight at 4 \u00b0C.

Sections werefinally counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoledihydrochloride (DAPI, 1 \u03bcg/ml) in PBS for 5 min at RT and mounted on slides with Vectashield (VectorLaboratories, Burlingame, CA). In selected sections, the primary antibody was omitted to assure labeling specificity.Confocal microscopy was performed with a Fluoview 1000microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) for immunofluorescenceimaging. Immunoreactivity quantification andmotor neuron count (in the case of organotypic culture) wereanalyzed with the ImageJ software [25], by selecting motorregion from anterior horns in the spinal cord. Motor neuronswere putatively identified by soma size, low DAPI fluorescence,and anterior location. All measurements and analyseswere done in a double-blinded fashion.\n\nRepresentative confocal images (left) and quantitative analyses (right) of DNA repair mechanisms (\u03b3H2Ax) and DHA-related decreases in DNA oxidative damage (8-oxo-dG) in whole LSC sections of 90-dayold G93A male mice, measured in immunohistochemistry.",

Eighteen days after the treatment of the melittin orsaline treatment, the brainstem and spinal cords were dissected and homogenized in RIPA buffer (50 mMTris-Cl pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, and 150 mMNaCl) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem,CA, USA). Homogenized tissues were centrifugedat 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The protein concentrationwas determined using a BCA assay (Pierce, IL,USA). Samples denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate(SDS) sampling buffer were seperated through SDSpolyacrylamidegel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferredto a nitrocellulose membrane for western blot.For detection of target proteins, the menbranes wereblocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBS and then incubatedwith the various primary antibodies: anti-tubulin(Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-p38 (Cell SignalingTechnologies), anti-phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling Technologies),anti-Iba-1 (Wako, Osaka, Japan), anti-TNF-aor anti-ubiquitin (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA).

Foreach segment, each section of a series of 10 was collected sequentially on separate gelatin-coated slides orfree-floating in Olmos medium.One slide of each animal was rehydrated for 1 minand stained for 2 h with an acidified solution of 3.1 mMcresyl violet. Then, the slides were washed in distilledwater for 1 min, dehydrated and mounted with DPX(Fluka). MNs counts were made for neuronal somapresent in the lateral part of lamina IX of the ventral hornin the spinal cord sections and following strict size andmorphological criteria: only MNs with diameters largerthan 20 \u03bcm, polygonal shape and prominent nucleoli werecounted. The number of MNs present in both ventralhorns was counted in four serial sections of each L4 andL5 segments [36,40], where motor nuclei innervating TA and plantar muscles are located [41].Another series of sections was blocked with PBS-Triton-FBS and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with rabbit primaryantibody against ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule1 (Iba1, 1:1000, Wako). After several washes, sections wereincubated for 1 hour at room temperature with Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200; Life Science). Forco-localizations, spinal MNs were labeled with 500/525-Neurotrace fluorescent Nissl staining (1:200, Life Science).To quantify microglial immunoreactivity, microphotographsof the ventral horn grey matter were taken at \u00d7 400and, after defining the threshold for background correction,the integrated density of Iba1 labeling was measured using ImageJ software. The integrated density represents the areaabove the threshold for the mean density minus the background.",

Primary spinal cord motor neurons (MNs) were cultured from E13.5 C57Bl/6 mouse embryos as described previously [70]. Cocultures were allowed to establish for 2 weeks and neuroprotection assays performed. Cocultures were exposed to drug or vehicle for 24 h followed by a 6-h treatment with menadione (10 \u03bcM) to induce oxidative stress or with no stress to determine the effect of drug alone. Following stress treatment, coverslips were washed 3 times, fixed, and permeabilised, and MNs immunostained with SMI32 (Covance, UK). Total MNs were counted by fluorescence microscopy in a 1.5 cm2 area per coverslip. A minimum of three repeats in triplicate were performed per condition. Both vehicle and drug treatments were counted with and without stress treatment, and results were analysed by twoway ANOVA using Bonferroni post tests.",

        "text": "Transgenic C57Bl/6 SOD1G93A model of ALS. All mouse experiments were carried out in accord with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 under a UK Home Office project license reviewed by the Sheffield University Ethical Review Committee Project Applications and Amendments Sub-Committee of the Sheffield University Ethical Review Committee and by the Animal Procedures Committee (London, UK). Pharmacology experiments in SOD1G93A transgenic mice were conducted according to the published guidelines for studies in this model [31]. Mice were originally obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, B6SJL-Tg (SOD1-G93A)1Gur/J (stock number 002726), and were subsequently backcrossed onto the C57Bl/6 background (Harlan UK, C57Bl/6 J OlaHsd) for >20 generations. Power analysis indicated that 13\u201315 mice per group would detect a difference in survival ratio of 10% which is widely accepted as biologically relevant and could detect a difference in time for rotarod performance to decline of 1 week. The litters were split to enable an even distribution of sex and parentage between the two comparison groups and the groups randomly assigned to treatment or control. Previous extensive experiments have indicated that this method of generating control groups provides robust data [36]. Our model, on a defined inbred genetic background, shows no effect of sex or litter of origin on survival [36]. Female SOD1G93A C57BL/6J mice were injected with 10 ml/kg of vehicle (0.1% DMSO in water), or S[+]-apomorphine at 0.5 mg/ml subcutaneously to give a final dose of 5 mg/kg, daily from 21 days of age through to end-stage (complete loss of righting reflex for more than 10 s). Behavioural assessment was carried out blinded to treatment group. Rotarod training was performed over 3 days with 2 trials per day. Subsequently, the rotarod test was performed once per week in the afternoon. On each day, mice were tested twice with a rest period in between tests. The best score was taken for analysis. The rotarod (Ugo Basile 7650) was set to accelerate from 4 to 40 rpm in 300 s. Latency to fall (s) was recorded in seconds for each mouse. The test was performed until mice reached a time of o5 s. The catwalk gait analysis system (Noldus Instruments, version 7.1) was used to capture gait parameters in groups of 5 G93A\u2014transgenic mice and 7 nontransgenic mice. Mice were tested every 2 weeks from 6 weeks of age to 16 weeks of age. They were placed on the catwalk apparatus in complete darkness and the recording of gait patterns was performed in a separate room. Multiple runs were recorded for each mouse and three selected for analysis. Processing of gait data was performed using the dedicated software, with the assignment of limbs performed manually and subsequent automated calculation of gait\nparameters.",

A 50-ml volume of 10 mM carboxy-H2DCFDA in 1X PBS was then added for 1 h and the plate read at Ex485 nm/Em530 nm. To measure the cell number the plate was freeze-thawed, 5 0ul of 2 mM EthD in PBS was added to each well, and the fluorescence read at Ex530 nm/Em645 nm. At the two apomorphine concentrations tested, there was no\neffect on cell number compared to the DMSO control; therefore data were analysed by removing blank values from the test carboxy-H2DCFDA fluorescence values.

        "text": "2.3. Mouse survival efficacy testing. We used general survival efficacy testing methods previously described for the current studies (Scott et al., 2008). For both efficacy studies, transgene copy number was verified and mice were assigned to either drug treatment or vehicle treatment groups at 50 days of age. Groups were balanced with respect to gender (16 males, 16 females per group) and body weight within gender (mean weights at study start were within 0.3 grams for either gender between groups). Litters were evenly represented across treatment and vehicle groups within each study. Observers were blinded to treatment group identity. Both CuATSM and ATSM were delivered as 3 mg/mL suspensions. CuATSM (American Advanced Scientific, catalog # AAS-11448) and ATSM (American Advanced Scientific, catalog # AAS-11446) were independently suspended in 0.5% Methyl Cellulose (Sigma, M0262) formulated in 0.9% Saline (Sigma, 07982) with the addition of 0.4% Tween 80 (Sigma, P8074). The drug preparations were sonicated for five minutes and mixed by inversion while in use. Formulations were produced daily. Mice were monitored for neurological disease progression according to the protocol detailed by us in the Journal of Visualized Experiments (Hatzipetros et al., 2015). Briefly, the NeuroScore is a five point observation based scoring system. Severity of disease is rated on a scale from 0 to 4 with 0 being asymptomatic and 4 representing a moribund phenotype secondary to paralysis which manifests primarily in the hind limbs of the mice. Neurological scoring procedures and body weight measurements were completed on a bench-top in the animal holding room. End-stage mice were euthanized in a separate procedure room. Euthanasia for animals in all studies was carried out by a Preset Flow System (VetEquip) CO2 chamber. This system is designed to follow the AVMA guidelines displacement rate, 10\u201330% of the chamber volume per minute. End-stage was defined by an inability of the mouse to right itself within 10 s when placed its side. The observing technician was required to test the mouse by placing the animal on both sides. Failure to right itself from either side resulted in euthanasia. Kaplan-Meier curves and long-rank tests were used to analyze age at onset of paresis and survival data using GraphPad Prism 6. Using JMP v10.0.2 statistical software by SAS Institute, Inc, we generated graphs of ordinal expected NeuroScore vs. median age at Neuroscore graphs for drug-treated and vehicle-treated animals by interpolating from the y-axis the median ages at each stage of Neuro Score based disease progression.",

For subcellular fractionation, primary cortical neurons fromembryonic day 20-21 rats were prepared as described above, and treated with drug or vehicle 6 days after plating.Cells were harvested 7 h after treatment in resuspension buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2)supplemented with 0.6% Igepal CA-30 (Sigma) to liberate the cytoplasmic fraction, and then in RIPA buffer tolyse the nuclear compartment, following a trypan blue assay for nuclear integrity. Protein content determined bythe BCA assay (Pierce) using a Nanodrop 2000. Samples normalized for protein content were run on 15% SDSpolyacrylamide gels. Primary antibodies against TDP43 (Barmada et al.21), Hsc70 (1:1000, Santa Cruz SC-7298),GAPDH (1:1000, Millipore MAB374), and Histone H2B (1:250 Novus Biologicals 50347) were detected using IRdye conjugated secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences), imaged on a LI-COR Odyssey, and quantified usingImageStudioLite (LI-COR Biosciences). Plots were generated and analyzed using GraphPad Prism.For immunoblots of animal brain, fresh tissues were collected and immediately subjected to nuclear andcytosolic fractionation using a fractionation kit (NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Fractionation Kit, Pierce,Rockford, IL). Fractionation followed manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Protein content determined by the Bio-RadProtein Assay Dye. Samples normalized for protein content were run on 4-15% SDS polyacrylamide gels. Primaryantibodies include anti-TDP43 (1:2000, ProteinTech 107282-2-AP), anti-human TDP43 (1:1500, AbnovaH00023435-M01), anti-GAPDH (1:2000, Ambion AM4300), and anti-lamin B2 (1:2000, Millipore MAB3536).Secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Dallas, Tx), and were used at a dilution of 1:10000.Chemiluminescence reagents were purchased from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, UK).For detection of XPO7 by immunocytochemistry, primary cortical neurons from embryonic day 20-21 ratswere prepared as described above, then transfected with plasmids encoding EGFP and XPO7 4 days after plating.Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X-100, and treated with 10 mMglycine before blocking in PBS containing 0.1% Triton, 2% FCS and 3% BSA, for 1 h at room temperature (RT).Detection was accomplished by incubating with anti-XPO7 primary antibodies (diluted 1:500 in blocking solution,(Proteintech, 12980-1-AP) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Samples were rinsed 3 times in PBS, incubated with Cy3 labeledanti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:250 in blocking solution; Millipore, AP132C) for 1 h at RT, then rinsed 3 moretimes in PBS containing a 1:1000 dilution of Hoechst 33258 nuclear dye (Invitrogen H3569) prior to imaging.",

        "text": "Image analysis. Neuronal survival was assessed in an unbiased and blinded manner using novel code writtenin Python. Twenty-five images per well of a 96 well plate were stitched together to cover a larger surface area,background fluorescence subtracted from the stitched images, and images from each timepoint assembled into atime series or stack. Individual neuronal soma and processes were segmented based on morphological characteristics,and time of death recorded as the last time a neuron was confirmed to be alive (left censoring). Cumulativeand instantaneous risk of death plots were calculated from this information using the survival analysis package inR. Statistical comparisons (Cox proportional hazards analysis and the log-rank test) were also accomplished in R.Regions of interest (ROIs) identified by blinded observers (Figs 5 and 6, S6) or by automated analysis(Figs 7 and 8, S6) corresponding to the cell body and nucleus were used to calculate the mean intensity offluorescently-labeled proteins within specific subcellular compartments. Expression of EGFP in these experimentswas necessary to outline the cell body and draw ROIs around the cytoplasm of transfected cells. For automatedanalysis, nuclei were identified and partitioned based upon their intensity via Baysian Gaussian Mixturemodelling. Cells were removed from the analysis if the nuclear intensity distribution suggested pyknosis, or if thesoma-centroid estimate was not contained within the innermost contiguous group of pixels. Data was compiledusing R, and scatter plots and graphs depicting changes in protein localization were created using GraphPadPrism.",

        "text": "Image analysis and quantification in microdevices. For image analysis and quantification, the chamber was divided vertically into ten 100 \u03bcm zones (permissive zones or bins) along the gradient. Each zone represents an average range of rapamycin concentration based on a linear concentration profile. Fluorescenceintensity, corresponding to the number of positive cells (in our case, motor neurons) was plotted against therapamycin concentration. GFP+cells were counted using ImageJ (NIH). As individual cells were not resolved atthe low magnification (5x), fluorescent intensities were used to quantify cells. An \u2018unsharp mask\u2019 was applied,followed by cell count (particle analysis). A native eGFP response on 7DIV(day-7) was used as the baseline forGFP expression. ANOVA in conjunction with an appropriate multiple comparison test was performed for statisticalsignificance (for a detailed comparison, see Sheet S1 ). A high resolution imaging for the localization ofnuclear TDP-43 to that of cytoplasmic TDP-43 without destroying the positional construct (gradient zones) wasnot possible in the microdevice samples (Figs. 6, 7a). The reason for this is, high resolution images are ratherdifficult to obtain in thick 3D cultures, even using confocal or epifluorescence techniques due to constraintsimposed by light scattering and absorptive processes. This, as well as the propensity of ESCs to cluster, is oneof the disadvantages of the 3D microfluidic approach and why high-resolution images were only provided forthe planar 2D cultures. A higher magnification image of a typical MN cluster in the microdevice showing theirmorphology is indicated in supplementary figure S4. This scattering/clustering does not preclude quantitative assessments of the total fluorescence or expression, which is the metric used in the 3D microdevice analysis asoutlined and referenced in our previous publication43.",

The SOD1G93A mice in the 3 groups (Tg-NT, Tg-Suc, Tg-Tre) and age-matched WT littermates were examined by EM. Twenty-five randomly selected EM images per animal were captured at a final magnification of 10,000 \u00d7 g, and the number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in each captured field was counted by visual inspection using previously established criteria for identification.12 In brief, autophagosomes were defined as the double-membrane structures, whose inside density was similar to that of the surrounding cytosol. Autolysosomes have only one limiting membrane, and contain cytoplasmic material and /or organelles at various stages of degradation. For mitochondria analysis, at least 20 randomly selected motor neurons per animal were captured at a final magnification of 5,000 \u00d7 , then the number and the major diameter of mitochondria in each motor neuron was calculated by the technician who was blinded to the experimental design.",

Noninvasive behavioral evaluations were made without causing excessive animal stress in order to provide data about muscular degeneration/locomotor activity loss. Hanging Wire Test (HWT) was performed to evaluate motor performance.The test consists in the capability of the animal into staying hanged to a wire for a time period of 90sec, using the paw strength. HWT was performed two times aweek starting from fourweeks before the disease onset and two weeks later and for a total number of fifteen tests. Also Open Field Test (OFT) for motor function was performed to test behavior and general motor function. GMGITC treated as well as untreated SOD1tg rats were monitored for a time period of 180 sec to assess the spontaneous activity in an open field, consisting of a white Plexiglas box (100 cm\u00d7 100 cm) with the floor divided into 16 squares. Four squares were defined as the center and 12 squares along the walls as the periphery. Each animal was gently placed in the center of the box and activity was scored as a line crossing when a mouse removed all four paws fromone square and entered another. Immediately after each test, the apparatus was thoroughly cleaned with cotton pad wetted with 70% ethanol. The test was performed once a week starting from two weeks before the disease onset and two weeks later, with the last measure performed the day before the sacrifice and for a total number of six tests.",

        "text": "2.8.Western Blot Analysis. Allwestern blot procedures aimed to assess the expression of mediators of ALS development were performed according to previously published protocols [17] and here modified for brain tissue and spleen. Briefly, all the extraction procedures were performed on ice using ice-cold reagents. Brain tissues or spleen were suspended in extraction buffer containing 0.32M sucrose, 10mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1mM EGTA, 2mM EDTA, 5mM NaN3, 10mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50mM NaF, and protease inhibitor tablets (Roche,Milan, Italy) and then homogenized at the highest setting for 2min.The homogenateswere chilled on ice for 15min and then centrifuged at 1000 g for 10min at 4\u2218C, and the supernatant (cytosol + membran e extract) was collected to evaluate content of citoplasmatic proteins. The pellets were suspended in the supplied complete lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150mM NaCl, 10mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1mM EGTA, and 1mM EDTA protease inhibitors tablets (Roche), and then they were centrifuged for 30min at 15,000 g at 4\u2218C, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected to evaluate the content of nuclear proteins. Supernatants were stored at \u221280\u2218C until use. Protein concentration in homogenate was estimated by Bio-Rad ProteinAssay (Bio-Rad, Segrate, Italy) using BSA as standard, and 20 \ud835\udf07g of cytosol and nuclear extract from each sample were analyzed. Proteins were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide minigels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran nitrocellulose transfer membrane; Whatman Schleicher and Schuell,Dassel, Germany), blocked with PBS containing 5%nonfat dried milk (PM) for 45min at roomtemperature, and subsequently probed at 4\u2218Covernight with the follow primary antibodies: TNF-alpha (1 : 100 in PM 0.1% Tween 20 (PMT) v/v; Cell Signaling Technologies), FoxP3 (1 : 500 in PMT v/v; eBioscience), and cleaved-caspase3 (1 : 1000 in PMT v/v; Cell Signaling Technologies). HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were incubated as secondary antibodies (1 : 2000 in PMT v/v; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. To ascertain that blots were loaded with equal amounts of proteic lysates, they were also incubated with GAPDH-HRP conjugated primary antibody (1 : 1000 in PMT v/v; Cell Signaling Technology). Relative protein bands expression was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Luminata Forte, Western HRP substrate, Millipore) and proteic bands were acquired and quantified with ChemiDoc MP System (Bio- Rad, Segrate, Italy) and a computer program (ImageJ software), respectively. Blots are representative of three separate and reproducible experiments. Statistical analysis was run on three repeated blots performed on separate experiments.",

Ten micrograms of protein lysate was added to proteasome activity assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) along with (Ac-RLR-AMC) (Boston Biochem, cat. no. s290) fluorogenic proteasome substrate. Reactions were allowed to incubate at 37\u00b0C protected from light for 3 hours. Following incubation, samples were transferred to black walled 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, cat No. 655097). Release of free 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin was determined using a SpectraMax M5e microplate reader (Molecular Devices) with excitation at 380 nm and emission recorded at 460 nm. Reported values are the fold increase over a no-protein control that was incubated along with every experiment. Native gels were performed similarly to as has previously described (44). Tissues were snap frozen and ground into powder with a pestle and mortar. Tissue powders (~50 \u03bcL) were then triturated using a 25G syringe on ice in native tissue lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (ph8.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM ATP) with 3 1-second vortex pulses. Lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 25 minutes at 20 000g. Clarified supernatants were transferred to a new tube and quantified as described above. Twenty micrograms of protein was loaded per well along with 6\u00d7 native protein loading buffer (Biorad cat # 1610738) into a 4% to 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel (Biorad cat # 5671094) in native running buffer (90 mM Tris base, 90 mM boric acid, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM ATP-MgCl2), and resolved for 3.5 hours at 100 V on ice. The gel was then soaked in transfer buffer (25 mM tris base, 192 mM glycine) containing 1% SDS for 5 minutes, then soaked for 10 minutes in transfer buffer without SDS. Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in transfer buffer at 250 mA for 90 minutes on ice. The membrane was then probed for the \u03b25 proteasome subunit (Enzo life sciences cat. no. BML-PW8895-0025) as described above for Western blot.",

        "text": "Grip strength test. The grip strength test was performed as previously described [31]. This test was developed as a supplemental method for the PaGE test. While the PaGE test evaluates the ability of a mouse to support its own body weight using only forelimbs and hindlimbs against gravity, body weight varies between individual mice, in part because of the heterogeneous C57BL/J6\u00d7SJL F1 hybrid genetic background. Therefore, the PaGE test is limited in its ability to accurately measure forelimb and hindlimb muscle strength of an individual mouse. To overcome this limitation, mice were presented with an irongrid with a fixed weight of 24 g. The irongrid was 5.5 cm\u00d78 cm, and was constructed with an iron wire 1.0 mm in diameter. To elicit gripping, the irongrid was presented to each mouse. By lifting the grid up, the mice was required to hold its own body with its forelimbs and hindlimbs against the pull of gravity. The time that each mouse held onto the grid was recorded. Each mouse was given up to three trials to hold onto the grid for 10 sec, and the longest latency time was recorded.",

Briefly, lumbar cords were surgically removed and post-fixed overnight in 4oC in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Fixed cords were cut coronally into 40 \u03bcm-thick sections with a vibratome (Leica VT 1000S; Leica Instruments, Nussloch, Germany). Cord sections were stained with 1% cresyl violet and the numbers of stained cells were determined using the TOMORO ScopeEye 3.6 system (Olympus, Japan) as previously described [31, 32]. For immunohistochemistry, free-floating sections were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4) for 1 h. Sections were then incubated with anti-HNE (Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc., TX, USA) or anti-ChAT (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) antibodies at 4oC overnight. The sections were then washed with PBST and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies diluted 1:200 in PBST. Immunoreactive regions were visualized using an ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA, USA). Anti- HNE stained sections were incubated with TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) diluted 1:200 in PBST. After washing, the sections were mounted with VECTASHIELD\u00ae Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). Anti-ChAT stained sections were washed with PBST and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody diluted 1:200 in PBST. Immunostained sections were visualized using an ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Images were captured with an Olympus BX 51 microscope equipped with a DP71 camera and DP-B software (Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan).

As previously described (Gerber et al., 2012a) we selected amongst locomotor patterns, the \u201crelative position\u201d that corresponds to the distance between the placement of front and hind paws over one walking step. For data collection, six runs per animal were performed on a weekly basis from day 60 (just prior the first injection) and until animals were not able to correctly cross the walkway due to hindlimb paralysis. For each mouse, a minimum of three runs crossed at the same speed with 3-full step sequence patterns per run were recorded. To accustom the animals to the environment and thus to avoid bias due to stress, we placed transgenic and control littermates mice on the CatWalk 7 and 3 days prior to the first recording session. Catwalk analyses started before the first injection, the next behavioral session was done at least 72 h after treatment. Recordings were performed until the failure to obtain satisfactory paw patterns with the CatWalk analysis system due to hindlimb paralysis and thus absence of paw detection in the transgenic groups. Data analysis was done in collaboration with InnovationNet (Tiranges, France).",

For identification c-Abl phosphorylation in specific cell types, primary spinal cultures were fixed at 7 DIV with 4% paraformaldehyde, and immunostained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against MAP2 and SMI-32 antibody, as indicated above in the section \u201ccell survival analysis.\u201d A mouse monoclonal antibody anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:600, Sigma, Cat. No. G393) was also used. For detecting active c-Abl, a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing phosphorylated Tyr-412 (1:1000 for slices; 1:600 for cultures in vitro; 1:2000 for western blot; Sigma; Cat. No. C5240) was used. For immunostainings in tissue, hSOD1G93A (>P120) and hSOD1G86R (P95) transgenic mice were sacrificed, perfused with 4% PFA and sectioned in crytostat obtaining 40 \u03bcm slices. All antibody bindings were visualized with the appropriate Alexa fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:500; Life Technologies). Our WT primary spinal cord cultures typically contain at least 6\u201310% motoneurons until 12 DIV (Sepulveda et al., 2010). Immunolabeled neurons were documented on an upright Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope (60x oil objective) or a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U microscope equipped with a SPOT PursuitTM USB Camera CCD (14-bit), Epi-fl Illuminator, mercury lamp and Sutter Smart-Shutter with a lambda SC controller. For quantification of cell number, cultures were photographed using a 20x objective; MAP2- and SMI-32-positive neurons were counted off\u2013line 20 randomly chosen fields, and the percentage of SMI-32-positive motoneurons within the total number of MAP2-positive cells was calculated. Each condition was replicated in at least three independent cultures, and in duplicate. For phospho-c-Abl quantification in cultures, fluorescence intensity was quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Briefly, cell body was marked manually to set a region of interest. The mean fluorescence was quantified for each cell and the background was subtracted choosing a region without cells. The fluorescence corresponding to control cells were normalized at 1.",

        "text": "Nitroxidative Stress Measurements with CM-H2DCF-DA. The intracellular levels of ROS/RNS were measured with CM-H2DCFDA (Invitrogen, Cat. No. C6827) as previously described (Rojas et al., 2014). H2DCF-DA is not a specific probe for a specific oxidant and has been used to monitor certain ROS/RNS (see Discussion). The CM-H2DCF-DA stock solution (1 mM) was prepared in DMSO and was diluted in the culture medium to a final concentration of 1 \u03bcM just before addition to the cells. After application of the diverse ACMs to the spinal cord cultures for different time (minutes-hours-days), cells were washed (PBS 1x) to remove the ACMs and exposed to CM-H2DCF-DA for 30 min at 37\u2218C in dark, to label both motoneurons and interneurons. To facilitate the CM-H2DCF-DA membrane penetration, 0.004% Pluronic acid F-127 (Invitrogen, Cat. No. P-3000MP) was added to the culture medium to facilitate dye entry, eliminate possible hydrolysis of dyes by external esterases and maintain better cell integrity (Appaix et al., 2012). After the incubation time, the CM-H2DCF-DA-cointaing culture medium was removed and cultures were washed twice with PBS 1X and suspended in culture medium (500 \u03bcl final volume). Next, cells were immediately imaged using an upright Nikon Eclipse Ti-U microscope equipped with a SPOT PursuitTM USB Camera CCD (14-bit), Epi-fl Illuminator, mercury lamp and Sutter Smart-Shutter with a lambda SC controller. Cells were photographed using a 20x objective. As CM-H2DCF-DA is a non-fluorescent dye it passively diffuses into cells and is hydrolyzed intracellularly to the DCFH carboxylate anion that is trapped inside; oxidation of DCFH results in the formation of the fluorescent product DCF, with excitation and emission wavelengths \u03bbex/\u03bbem = 492\u2013495/517\u2013527 nm. The exposure time was kept below 4 s in order to avoid photo-oxidation of the ROS/RNS sensitive dye and for all given treatments fields were exposed for exactly the same amount of time. At least three independent fields were acquired for each condition and at least 10 cells per field were used for quantification of the fluorescence signal. Cells were masked by drawing a region of interest around the cell body, and mean fluorescence intensity was calculated for each cell after subtraction of the background signal using the image analysis module in ImageJ software. All cells, independent of ttheir relative intensity unit (RIU), were included in the analysis. Cultures were also incubated with H2O2 (200 \u03bcM for 20 min) to serve as a positive control.",

Briefly, third instar larvae were placed at room temperature on grape juice plates made of 2.5% agar and grape juice. Larvae are allowed to acclimate on the grape plate, then gently turned ventral side up. Larvae were individually timed from the time they are turned to the time they reorientate themselves ventral side down and make their first forward motion. The number of larvae tested in each experiment has been noted in the appropriate Results section. Larval turning data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison tests (GraphPad Prism v7).",

A good performance requires a high degree of sensorimotor coordination. It consists of a computer-controlled motor-driven rotating spindle and five lanes for five mice. Falls of the mice are detected automatically by pressure on a plastic plate at the bottom. After training for three times at a constant speed of 15 rpm and for the duration of 180 s, mice were tested every 3 days beginning on d80 and the time for which an animal can remain on the rotating rod is measured. For animals which could not remain 180 s on the rotarod, a second and third trial with a break of 10 min was applied. Means of all trials of each animal were included in the statistical analysis. The time of 180 s is chosen as an arbitrary cut-off time because the majority of significant differences in motor coordination are detected in this time frame.",

Thereafter, they were transcardially perfused with PBS solution followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Spinal cords were removed as described before (G\u00fcnther et al., 2012) and were post-fixed for 2 h in 4% paraformaldehyde. Thereafter, the tissue was dehydrated in 30% sucrose overnight and kept at \u221220\u00b0C until further processing. Coronal sections of the lumbar spinal cord (L3\u2013L6) with a thickness of 20 \u03bcm were prepared using a cryostat (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and collected on gelatine-coated glass slides.Spinal cord sections were immunolabeled with the primary antibodies (anti-ChAT, 1:100, Millipore; anti-Iba1, 1:500, WAKO, Osaka, Japan) and subsequently with the respective secondary antibodies (Cy3 anti-goat or Cy2/Dylight anti-rabbit; both Dianova).In order to quantify MN numbers in the ventral horn of coronal cryosections from the lumbar spinal cord, cells in the ventral horn were counted as MN if they had a clearly identifiable nucleolus, were at least 200 \u03bcm2 in size and were ChAT-positive. At least ten sections per mouse spinal cord including both ventral horns being at least 100 \u03bcm apart over a length of at least 1000 \u03bcm from the lumbar spinal cord were counted. In the treatment groups a total number of nine mice were analyzed from vehicle (n = 3), Fas30 (n = 3) and Fas100 (n = 3). Microgliosis was evaluated by the quantification of Iba1 positive cells in the ventral horn of lumbar spinal cord sections. In contrast to the MN analysis MG were not confined to ventral horn region. Therefore, the ventral horn area was measured and Iba1 positive cells were manually counted and plotted as cell numbers per 0.2 mm2. A total number of nine mice each gender was analyzed from vehicle (n = 3), Fas30 (n = 3) and Fas100 (n = 3). Means of both ventral horns were calculated and the mean of all sections of each animal was included in the final statistical analysis for both ChAT and Iba1 cell numbers.",

The animals\u2019 ability to climb is hindered with disease progression, initially with leg tremors, followed by gradual deterioration until the mice are unable to climb up the ladder. The animals were scored based on their performance on the ladder test. A score of 12 represents completely healthy mice and 0 correlates with end stage disease. From the age of 7 weeks, the mice were evaluated weekly for their ability to climb the ladder and were scored weekly. The score was determined using the guidelines described in Table 2.",

With disease progression, hSOD1G93A mice lose the ability to extend their legs and this reflexive extension is gradually lost. From the age of 7 weeks, the mice were evaluated weekly for their hind leg reflexes. Hindlimb extension reflexes were evaluated as described previously [39]. Mice were suspended by the tail, and the degree of motor deficits in the hind limbs was scored from 0 to 2 as follows: a normal extension reflex in both hind limbs\u20142; imbalanced extension in the hind limbs\u20141.5; extension reflex in only one hind limb\u20141.0; the absence of any hind limbs extension\u20140.5; and total paralysis was scored 0.

Histological Analysis. hSOD1G93A mice treated with TAK-242 or vehicle (3 animals in each group) were anesthetized and sacrificed at the age of 100 days, at an early symptomatic disease stage. WT littermates were used as controls. Mice were transcardially perfused with PFA 4%. The rostral part of the spinal cord was frozen for further analysis, and the caudal part was used for histological motor neuron analysis and immunohistochemistry. Lumbar spinal cords were dissected, embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT, Tissue-Tek; Scigen Scientific, Gardena, CA, USA), sectioned (10 \u00b5m) using a cryostat, and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). To compare the number of motor neurons, we counted the large motor neurons (greater than 25 \u00b5m in diameter) in the ventral horn gray matter in 9 lumbar spinal cord sections from each animal. The results of motor neuron counting were expressed as the average of total motor neurons counted per one ventral horn in each group. For immunohistochemistry, slides were incubated with blocking solution (5% goat serum, 1% Bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton-X in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) for 1 h. Then, slides were incubated overnight at 4 \u25e6C with the following primary antibodies: rat anti-GFAP (1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), goat anti-ChAT (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse anti-S100\u03b2 (1:10; Abcam), and goat anti-IBA1 (1:200; Abcam). Then, sections were incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor anti goat-488, anti-mouse-488, or anti rat-568 (1:200\u20131:1000; Invitrogen) for 1 h. The nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Microscopic pictures were taken by ApoTome microscope (ZEISS, Jena, Germany). ZEN pro 2012 software was used for staining intensity quantification.",

        "text": "Survival. The initial sign of disease in G93A transgenic mice is a resting tremor that progresses to gait impairment, asymmetrical or symmetrical paralysis of the hindlimbs, followed by complete paralysis at the end stage. For the early treatment group and the corresponding vehicle group, mice were killed when they were unable to roll over within 20 s after being pushed on their sides and this time point was recorded as the time of death. For the symptom-onset treatment group and its corresponding control group, mice were killed when they displayed any signs of labored breathing or when they were no longer able to eat and drink, as evidenced by significant weight loss in a 24-h period. The untreated control group was treated in an identical manner, except that no injections were given. Upon killing, mice were examined for evidence of peritonitis or any obvious abnormalities related to the i.p. injections. Any mice showing signs of peritonitis or pathology related to injections were excluded from the study. Survival was assessed for all four groups.",

        "text": "Histological evaluation. Mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl. Brains and spinal cords were removed and immediately frozen on solid CO2. The spinal cords were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 48 h, and the tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight. Serial transverse sections (50 lm thick) were cut on a cryostat and collected for Nissl staining and immunohistochemistry. Every ninth section through the lumbar spinal cord was immunostained with a rabbit anti-serum against malondialdehyde-modified protein (provided by Dr Craig Thomas, Hoechst Marion Roussel) using a modified avidin-biotin peroxidase technique (Hsu et al. 1981). Free-floating sections were pre-treated with 3% H2O2 in PBS for 30 min to inactive endogenous peroxidases. All sections were pre-incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min on an orbital shaker at room temperature. The sections were incubated in rabbit anti-albumin-modified malondialdehyde (diluted 1 : 1000 in 0.5% BSA/PBS) overnight, followed by biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratory, Burlingance, CA, USA) incubation for 1 h (diluted 1 : 200 in 0.5% BSA/PBS). After washing with 0.5% BSA/ PBS (3 \u00b7 5 min), the sections were incubated in avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (diluted 1 : 200 in PBS) for 1 h. The immunoreaction was visualized using 3,3\u00a2-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride dihydrate (DAB) with nickel intensification (Vector) as the chromogen. The sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides, dehydrated, cleared in xylene and coverslipped. The specificity of immunostaining was confirmed by pre-incubation of the antibody with antigen and by omission of the primary antibody. The intensity of malondialdehyde immunostaining in the gray and white matter within the lumbar spinal cord was graded blindly using a semiquantitative scale of weak (+), moderate (+ +) and intense (+ + +).Sections adjacent to those used for immunocytochemistry were stained with cresyl violet. Every fourth section was analyzed for neuronal volume and number using optical fractionator and nucleator probes of the Stereo Investigator System (Microbrightfield, Colchester, VT, USA). Six tissue sections of the lumbar spinal cord from each mouse were analyzed. All cells were counted from within the ventral horn below a horizontal line across the gray matter through the ventral border of the central canal.",

Spinal cords were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM MgCl2,2mM EDTA pH 6.8, 20 mM HEPES and protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA).

Derivatization of the spinal cord homogenates (15 lg of total protein) was performed using the OxyBlot protein oxidation detection kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then, samples were applied directly to a 4\u201320% gradient Tris-glycine sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel (Invitrogen life technolo- gies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or stored at 4 C for a later use for up to a week. Electrophoresis was carried out for 90 min at 125 V, and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane for 60 min at 70 V under cold conditions. The membranes were then blocked with 1% BSA/Tris buffered saline Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker. The membranes were then incubated with a primary antibody specific to the dinitrophenyl (DNP) moiety of the protein (dilution of 1 : 150 in 1% BSA/TBST) overnight at 4 C on an orbital shaker. The blot was washed with TBST (5 \u00b7 10 min) and incubated with secondary antibody (dilution of 1 : 300 in 1% BSA/TBST) for 2 h. Enhanced chemiluminescence (Supersignal; Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) was used and exposed to X-ray film for 5 min to detect DNP-conjugated protein.

        "text": "HPLC method for FeTCPP in mouse tissue. Mouse tissues (age of onset-treated group, n \u00bc 9) were homogenized in four volumes of water and sonicated. NaOH was added to a final concentration of 50 mM and an equal volume of ethyl acetate was added and vigorously mixed. After centrifugation, the ethyl acetate layer was removed and the aqueous layer acidified with HCl. An equal volume of tert-butyl methyl ether (tBME) was added, mixed vigorously and separated by centrifugation. The tBME layer was removed and taken to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge. Dried extracts were resuspended in a minimum volume of methanol (MeOH) followed by addition of an equal volume of 100 mM KOH. Resuspended samples were clarified by centrifugation and supernatant fluids injected into the HPLC. FeTCPP standards were prepared and suspended in the same MeOH\u2013KOH solution. Separation was achieved using a 4.6 \u00b7 150 mm Waters Sperisorb ODS-II column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) maintained at 48 C in a column oven. FeTCPP was eluted using a gradient consisting of 0.2% heptafluorobutyric acid in water (buffer A), acetonitrile (buffer B) and MeOH (buffer C). FeTCPP in mouse tissues was identified by its retention time (9.96 min) and by its characteristic UV-visible spectrum using a Shimadzu diode-array detector (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD, USA). FeTCPP was quantified via its absorbance at 400 nm relative to standards of pure FeTCPP. Untreated mouse tissues were spiked with known concentrations of FeTCPP (similar to those found in treated mice) and extracted just as with treated mice samples. The extraction efficiency was determined for brain, spinal cord, kidney and liver and used to calculate concentrations of FeTCPP in the original wet tissues. For the purposes of calculating and expressing tissue concentrations of drug, one microgram of wet tissue was considered to be equal to one microliter.",

The levels of PGE2 in brain and spinal cord tissues were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Briefly, frozen cerebral cortex and spinal cords were homogenized in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (containing 1 mM EDTA and 10 lM indomethacin).After homogenization, samples were spiked with 10 000 d.p.m. of 5,6,8,11,12,14,15(n)[3 H] PGE2 (specific activity 151 Ci/mmol; Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA), mixed and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 25 min.Supernatant fluids were removed, mixed with an equal volume of ethanol and centrifuged at 1500 g.The supernatant fluids were diluted with 50 mM acetate buffer and purified through an affinity column (Cayman Chemical) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.The purified samples were evaporated, redissolved in enzyme-linked immunoassay buffer and applied to 96-well plates pre-coated with goat anti-mouse IgG and incubated with PGE2 monoclonal antibody and recovery tracer for 18 h at 4C.The plate was rinsed five times with washing buffer and developed using Ellman\u2019s reagent for 60\u201390 min at room temperature with gentle shaking.The PGE2-specific concentration was determined spectrophotometrically and calculated by plotting the standard percentage B/B0 (% sample or standard Bound/ Maximum Bound) versus PGE2 concentration (in pg/mL) using PGE2 analysis software and expressed in pg/mg of tissue.

Mice expressing high copy numbers of human mutant G93A-SOD1 were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) [strain designation B6SJL-TgN-(SOD1 G93A)-1-Gur; Gurney et al. 1994, 1996, 1998]. Transgenic mice were maintained in the hemizygous state by mating G93A males with B6SJL-TGN females. Animals were fed ad libitum standard AIN93G diets or the same diets formulated with NDGA at 2500 p.p.m. with drug administration started at 90 days. At this stage of life, G93A-SOD1 animals begin to demonstrate motor weakness and fine limb tremors (Gue\u00b4gan and Przedborski 2003). The feeding study used 16 mice per group. The group receiving NDGA consisted of five male and 11 female mice; the control group consisted of four male and 12 female mice. All diets and dietary drug formulations were provided by Dyets, Inc. (Bethlehem, PA, USA). All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. Motor performance was evaluated by means of a rotarod task, by a technician blinded to the treatment groups. Mice were placed on a horizontal rod that was made to rotate at 1 r.p.m. with an acceleration rate of 1 r.p.m. every 10 s until the animal fell from the rod. Each animal was tested three times per trial. Rotarod tests were conducted at 90 days (baseline), 100 days of age and subsequent 5-day intervals. Animals were killed when no longer able to right themselves within 10 s of being placed on their sides. Statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad PrismTM statistical analysis package (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).",

Total RNA was isolated from spinal cords of non-transgenic control and G93A+ transgenic mice by using TRI Reagent (Sigma) according to the supplier\u2019s protocol. Samples of RNA (5 lg) were reverse transcribed using oligo(dT)15 to prime the reaction in the presence of avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) RT (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. On completion, each reaction was diluted to a final volume of 50 lL with TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). PCR amplification of a 309-bp 5LOX gene product from the above-described mouse cDNAs was accomplished with Taq DNA polymerase (Roche), utilizing the buffer supplied and final concentrations of 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP and 0.3 lM of each primer. Final reaction volumes were 50 lL. Mouse 5LOX primers were 5\u00a2- GGCACCGACGACTACATCTAC-3\u00a2 (forward) and 5\u00a2-CAATTTTGCACGTCCATCCC-3\u00a2 (reverse). Beta-actin primers [5\u00a2- CGGCCAGGTCATCACTATTG-3\u00a2 (forward) and ACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCAC-3\u00a2 (reverse)] yielding a 353-bp PCR product were used as normalization controls. The number of PCR amplification cycles was determined empirically to yield detectable product bands that were approximately linear with respect to initial cDNA concentration. For 5LOX, optimal cycling conditions were: 2 min at 94C, one cycle; 1 min at 94C, 1 min at 56C and 1 min at 72C for 27 cycles; 7 min at 72C, one cycle. Conditions for actin primers were the same except that an annealing temperature of 54C was used and 24 cycles were performed. Samples of 25 lL from each reaction were electrophoresed in 2% agarose/TBE [tris/borate/ EDTA buffer (0.09 M Tris, 0.09 M borate, 0.002 M EDTA)] gels for 1.5 h, stained with ethidium bromide and photographed with a NucleoVision (Nucleotech, Westport, CT, USA) imaging system.5LOX is increased in G93A-SOD1 mouse spinal cord.",

        "text": "Immunochemistry and histology. Polyclonal anti-SOD1 IgG was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA, USA). Polyclonal anti-5LOX IgG was purchased from Cayman Chemical. Monoclonal anti-5LOX was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington KY, USA). Polyclonal antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was purchased from Research Diagnostics International (Flanders, NJ, USA). The positive control for 5LOX western blots was SL-29 fibroblast lysate (Transduction Laboratories; provided with the antibody). Electrophoresis was performed on 4\u201320% gradient polyacrylamide gels, and bands were visualized with chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Cleaved microtubule-associated tau protein (C-tau) was measured in the heat-soluble fraction of total spinal cord lysate as described previously (Zemlan 1999; Zemlan and Jauch 1999; Zemlan et al. 1999). Spinal cord samples were homogenized in in 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 6.8), 0.3 M NaCl, 1% b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 lM leupeptin. Homogenates were centrifuged at 30 000 g for 5 min at 4C. Supernanants were boiled for 10 min then centrifuged for 30 min at 30 000 g and 4C. The final supernatants were dialyzed overnight against 50 mM Tris-HCl. C-tau levels in these heat-soluble fractions were measured by sandwich ELISA as described previously, using affinity-purified monoclonal antibody 12B2 (Zemlan 1999; Zemlan and Jauch 1999; Zemlan et al. 1999). For immunohistochemistry, mice were terminally anesthetized and perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. The spinal cord was removed and the lumbar L5 region was processed for paraffin embedding. Serial cross-sections of the L5 spinal cord region were cut at 5 lM thickness. Immunostaining was performed using serial L5 spinal cord sections with antibodies to glial GFAP (dilution 5 lg/mL; Chemicon). Negative immunohistochemical controls were treated in the same way but in the absence of primary antibody. GFAP-labeled sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.",

Three trials were performed, and if mice were no longer able to stay on the rod for at least 10 min, this was used as a sign of disease onset, as well as the appearance of tremor of the hind legs and gait abnormalities. Starting at day 70 of age and continued until mice were unable to perform the task, motor function was also assessed twice a week by a 12 rpm paradigm: the time that mice stayed on the rod (until falling off or staying for a maximum of 5 min) was recorded as a measurement of the competence of their motor function.

        "text": "Histological evaluation and stereological analysis. Four groups of animals were used for histological evaluation at 110 days of age: wild-type mice (n = 5), ALS G93A SOD1 transgenic mice receiving vehicle treatment (n = 6), G93A SOD1 transgenic mice receiving DP-109 treatment (n = 4) or DP-460 (n = 8) treatment. Mice were perfused transcardially with cold 0.1 mol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 min followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. The spinal cords were carefully dissected and the lumbar segments were identified using the ribs and the vertebrae as guide. Tissues were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 6 h. Blocks were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 24 h. Serial coronal sections (50 lm thick) were cut through the lumbar (L1 fi L4) spinal cord enlargement of the wild type, vehicle, DP109, and DP-460 treated G93A mice. One set of sections was mounted onto gelatin-coated slides and stained for Nissl substance using cresyl violet. Unbiased stereological counts of Nissl-stained motor neurons in the ventral horn were determined in 10 serial non adjacent (250 lm apart) sections using the optical fractionator method. Analysis was performed using a system consisting of a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with a computer-controlled LEP BioPoint motorized stage, a DEI-750 video camera, a Dell Dimension 4300 computer, and the Stereo Investigator (v. 4.35) software program (Microbrightfield, Burlington, VT, USA). Cell counts were made within an area demarcated by a horizontal line drawn through the central canal and encompassing the ventral horn of the gray matter to include layers 7\u20139. The size of the x\u2013y sampling grid was 200 lm. The counting frame thickness was 14 lm and the counting frame area was 4900 lm2. Data were expressed as the means \u00b1 SEM. Differences among means were analyzed using ANOVA followed by Newman\u2013Keuls post hoc test. The coefficient of error and coefficient of variation were also determined. A separate set of sections was collected as free-floating sections and processed for immunohistochemistry using a modified avidin\u2013 biotin peroxidase technique. The following antibodies were used: rat anti-CD40 (1 : 100; Serotec, Raleigh, NC, USA), goat anti-CD40L (1 : 1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-4-hydroxynonenal (1 : 1000; Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland), rabbit polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine, goat antiTNF-a (1 : 100; Serotec), and sheep anti-a-synuclein (1 : 1000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). The immunoreaction was visualized using 3,3\u00a2-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride dihydrate with nickel intensification (Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) as the chromogen. The sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides, dehydrated, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped.",

        "text": "Lifespan study. Disease progression was initially assessed by behavioral observation and by monitoring body weight. From 75 days of age, each animal in all experimental groups were weighed twice a week and from 110 days, all animals were observed and weighed daily. In these experiments, mice were determined as having reached end-stage when they had either lost 15% of their maximum bodyweight (as measured at 75 days) or lost the ability to right themselves within 20 s when turned on their back. At this point, animals were humanely killed. For lifespan analysis, a total of 75 SODG93A mice were assessed, divided into the following treatment groups: vehicle treated SODG93A mice (n = 30), SODG93A mice treated with arimoclomol from 75 days (n = 21) and SODG93A mice treated with arimoclomol from 90 days (n = 24).

        "text": "Physiological assessment of muscle function and motor unit number. For the physiological assessment of muscle function and motor unit survival, a separate set of experimental mice were established (n = 51): Experimental groups included wild-type (WT) mice (n = 6); SODG93A mice treated with arimoclomol (i.p) from 75 days (n = 20); SODG93A mice treated with arimoclomol (i.p) from 90 days (n = 20) as well as SODG93A mice treated with vehicle (saline; n = 24). Each SODG93A experimental group was subdivided into male and female gender groups and each gender group consisted of at least 10 mice. In addition, a number of female SODG93A mice were treated orally with arimoclomol from 35 days (n = 5). When the mice were 120-day old, they were deeply anesthetized (4.5% chloral hydrate; 1mL/100 g of body weight, i.p) and prepared for in vivo analysis of muscle function. The distal tendons of the TA and the EDL muscles in both hindlimbs were dissected free and attached by silk thread to isometric force transducers (Dynamometer UFI Devices, Welwyn Garden City, UK). The sciatic nerve was exposed and sectioned, and all branches cut except for the deep peroneal nerve that innervates the TA and EDL muscles. The length of the muscles was adjusted for maximum twitch tension and the muscle and nerves were kept moist with saline throughout the recordings. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (23C). Isometric contractions were elicited by stimulating the nerve to EDL and TA using square-wave pulses of 0.02 ms duration at supra-maximal intensity, via silver wire electrodes. Contractions were elicited by trains of stimuli at frequencies of 40, 80, and 100 Hz. The maximum tetanic tension was measured using a computer and appropriate software (Scope, Loredan Biomedical, Davis, CA, USA). The number of motor units innervating the EDL muscles was determined by stimulating the motor nerve with stimuli of increasing intensity, resulting in step wise increments in twitch tension because of successive recruitment of motor axons. The number of stepwise increments was counted to give an estimate of the number of motor units present in each EDL muscles.Effect of arimoclomol on muscle function in SODG93A mice",

At three stages of disease representing pre-symptomatic (60d; n = 5), symptomatic (100d; n = 4) and end-stage (130D; n = 5), WT (n = 6), SODG93A vehicle-treated (n = 6) and SODG93A arimoclomol-treated mice (treated from 75 days and 90 days, n = 6 in each subgroup) were perfused transcardially with saline and the lumbar spinal cord and sciatic nerves removed and homogenized in homogenization buffer (5 mM Tris, 2% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 1% protease inhibitor cocktail pH 6.8). Samples were spun at 17 530 g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad assay system (Bi-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK; Cat#: 500-0116) and a series of BSA standards. Inducible Hsp70 in mouse tissue samples was measured by ELISA as described elsewhere (Kustanova et al. 2006). In brief, ATP was conjugated to ovalbumin and immobilized onto the surface of a medium binding capacity ELISA plate (Greiner, Solingen, Germany). Immobilization was performed at 37C for 1 h in buffer T (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2). Buffer T, containing 0.2% Tween 20 (T-Tw), was then used for blocking as well as for all subsequent steps and washes. Calibration standards of pure Hsp70 (Stressgen, Assay Designs Inc, Ann Harbor, MI, USA; NSP-555) and mouse tissue extracts in T-Tw were applied to the wells for 1 h, after which the wells were washed and anti-Hsp70 rabbit polyclonal antibody, R2 (1 : 1000; this antibody was raised in rabbits immunized with a complex antigen consisting of native and denatured mixture of Hsp70/Hsc70), was added, followed by goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA). 3,3\u00a2,5,5\u00a2-tetramethyl-benzidine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA, T-0440) and hydrogen peroxide were used to develop the calorimetric reaction which was stopped after 15 min by the addition of 0.2 M sulfuric acid. The optical density was measured at 450 nm using the Safire plate reader (Tecan, Gro\u00a8dig, Austria) and Hsp70 quantities in samples were determined using the calibration curve (0.50\u2013250 ng/mL) obtained from the titrated standards.The effect of arimoclomol on Hsp70 expression in SODG93A mice",

Motor performance was evaluated twice weekly by a rotarod test (Columbus Instruments, OH, USA), paw grip endurance (PaGE), and an extension reflex of hindlimbs, beginning at 10 weeks of age after a 2-week learning period. The time period that mice remained on a rotarod rotating at a constant speed of 16 rpm was measured, with 300 s chosen as the arbitrarycut-off time. Animals performed three trials for each evaluation, and the longest duration achieved was recorded. PaGE was used to quantify the grip strength of the mouse. The wire lid was gently shaken to prompt the mouse to hold onto the grid before the lid was flipped upside down. The time before the mouse let go of the grid with at least both hindlimbs was measured. Each mouse was allowed three attempts to hold onto the inverted lid for an arbitrary maximum of 200 s, and the longest duration was recorded. The extension reflex was quantified using the following 4-point scoring system: 0 for loss of reflex, with hindlimbs and paws held close to the body; 1 for loss of reflex with marked flexion of the hindlimbs; 2 for hindlimbs extending to <90 degrees with a decreased extension reflex in bilateral hindlimbs; 3 for hindlimbs extending to <90 degrees with decreased extension reflex in unilateral hindlimbs; and 4 for hindlimbs reflexly extending to form an angle of approximately 120 degrees. The body weight of the mice was measured twice weekly. The day of death was defined as when a mouse could no longer roll over within 30 s after being placed on its side on a flat surface.",

        "text": "Behavioral Testing. Behavioral testing was performed every 5 days between 7 and 10 AM by persons blind to the drug condition and genotype. Testing was started at P35 for the Fluox and Cypro P5-11 and Fluox P30 studies. Testing was started at P50 for mice that began fluoxetine treatment at P70. Near end stage, mice were tested every day or every other day. Weight, tremor, rotarod performance, and end stage were monitored for all mice. Tremor was determined on a five-point scale: 0 (no tremor), 1 (very small amplitude, induced by manually stroking the limb, constrained to 1 or 2 limbs), 2 (medium amplitude, induced or present at rest, constrained to 1 or 2 limbs), 3 (large amplitude, induced or present at rest, spread to 2 limbs), 4 (very large amplitude, present in all limbs). Tremor onset was defined as the first of three consecutive observations where the mouse scored a 1 or higher. Rotarod training occurred on three consecutive days before rotarod testing commenced. During testing, the rotarod was set to 4 rpm and increased 4 rpm every 30 s up to a maximum rotation of 20 rpm at 120 s. The rotarod then maintained a rotational speed of 20 rpm for 60 s, for a total of 180 s. Mice were run three times with a minimum of 5 min between each run. The time of the longest run and the age at which the mice failed to complete the entire protocol (180 s) on all three runs were recorded. End stage was defined as when the mice could no longer maintain themselves on the rotarod for 5 s, about one-third of a turn on the rotarod. This corresponded to gross motor deficits and the inability to maintain body weight. Voluntary locomotion was monitored every 10 days for both neonatal studies (Fluox and Cypro P5-11) and the Fluox P30 study. Each mouse was placed in an empty cage with a 2   3 grid on the bottom. Line crossings were recorded for 3 min to determine whether the drugs altered their general locomotor and exploratory behavior. The cage was cleaned after each mouse. Water consumption was monitored for the Fluox P70 study to determine whether fluoxetine treatment altered drinking behavior (recorded from P50 to P110).",

        "text": "Intracellular Whole Cell Recordings. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings were made with glass electrodes (resistance 2\u20135 M ) from visualized motoneurons in acute transverse slices (350 m) from the lumbar spinal cord of mice (P6-10) during bath application of citalopram (2\u201310 M) and -methyl 5-HT (0.1\u2013 0.3 M). After drug application, it was occasionally necessary to apply a hyperpolarizing holding current to maintain the motoneuron close to the previous resting potential for consistency. PICs were measured in voltage-clamp mode from cells with series resistance   15 M  as described previously in Quinlan et al. (2011). Depolarizing current ramps and steps were used in current-clamp mode to measure firing threshold voltage, action potential properties including overshoot and width at halfpeak, afterhyperpolarization after single action potentials (AHP), the slope of the firing frequency-current relationship, and the current at which firing commences (I-ON) and ceases (I-OFF). Other cell properties including resting potential, input resistance, and sag and rebound potentials (the hallmarks of the IH current) were also recorded in current clamp. All data were acquired with custom WinFluor software (University of Strathclyde), all analyses were made in Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design), and statistics were tested in SPSS.",

At 84, 105 (early symptomatic stage) and 126 (late stage) days of age (each n = 6\u201312), mice were intraperitoneally injected with 300 mg/ kg of D\u2010luciferin (OZ Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) dissolved in phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS) 15 min before in vivo optical im\u2010 aging. Under constant anesthesia, the skin of back and lower limbs (LL) was then opened to show the vertebrae and muscles of LL. In the preliminary experiment, mice died too early after laminectomy to detect direct bioluminescent signals from the spinal cords (data not shown). Therefore, we analyzed bioluminescent signals of spi\u2010 nal cords through vertebrae at a 3\u2010min exposure time after incision. In vivo optical signals of oxidative stress in Nrf2/G93A mice were observed as bioluminescence of exogenous human Nrf2 fragment combined with flag\u2010tagged luciferase, induced by endogenous Nrf2 dissociated from Keap1 (Oikawa et al., 2012). Bioluminescent sig\u2010 nals of the spinal cords and bilateral LL were measured using regions of interest (ROIs), and emission intensity was expressed as the total flux of photons (photons/s) by LivingImage software (PerkinElmer) (Nakano et al., 2017).",

Dissected lumbar spinal cords were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 2 h. For the misfolded SOD1 (C4F6) antibody immunostaining, spinal cords were fresh dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight. All tissue was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4\u00b0C until tissue was sunk. Tissues were embedded in OCT medium by freezing in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen and horizontal 20-\u00b5m sections were cut. For motor neuron counts, sections were stained with 0.5% cresyl violet using a standard protocol, dehydrated and coverslipped. Nisslpositive motor neurons in every third section were counted from a total of 30 ventral horns per mouse (n\u2009=\u20095 mice per group) identified by neuronal morphology and size exceeding 20-\u00b5m diameter with a distinct nucleolar profile. Counts were conducted by 2 investigators who were blinded to the treatment groups, and averages were obtained.",

Identical exposure and gain settings were used to capture the images, and the negative controls without primary antibodies produced no staining. Misfolded SOD1 aggregates were counted from at least 20 motor neurons per mouse with 5 mice per treatment group. LC3-positive APs and LAMP2-positive lysosomes were counted from at least 10 motor neurons per mouse and averaged with n=3 mice per treatment group. Analysis of TOMM20 staining was performed using ImageJ software. Images were converted to grayscale and the area above threshold was determined. The same threshold brightness level was used for all images. Ten images per mouse were analyzed with 4 mice per genotype. Image analysis was restricted to nuclear RBFOX3/NeuN-positive motor neurons only.Rilmenidine enhances macroautophagy and clears mutant SOD1 protein from NSC-34 cells",

The sample was incubated the on ice for 10 min and then 5.5 mL of ice-cold CER II was added. The sample was vortexed for 10 s on the highest setting, and then incubated on ice for 2 mins. The sample was vortexed on the highest setting for 15 s and then centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 mins at 4C.

A further 250 mL of Trizol and 100 ml of chloroform was added and the tube was vigorously shaken for 15 s at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min at 4C and the upper-aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh and pre-chilled tube. The chloroform extraction was repeated on the aqueous phase. RNA was precipitated in 2 volumes of 100% ethanol and 1/10th the volume of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2, and the RNA sample was left on ice for 25 mins. The samples were then centrifuged at maximum speed at 4C for 10 mins. The RNA pellet was washed in 70% ethanol and centrifuged at maximum speed at 4C for 10 mins. The pellet was air-dried and the RNA was dissolved in 40 mL of DEPC-treated water. Genomic DNA in half of the RNA sample was digested with turbo DNase (Ambion) using the vigorous protocol. 500 ng of RNA was used for first-strand DNA synthesis by Superscript III (ThermoFisher Scientific) with random primers. Fast SYBR Green (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used for real-time analysis. Standard curves were used to test the efficiency of all the primers and to determine the amount of cDNA to add to the PCR reaction.

        "text": "Co-immunoprecipitation. To co-immunoprecipitate PARylated protein and TDP-43 from male fly heads the Pierce co-immunoprecipitation kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, 100 mL (1mg/ml) of anti-PAR (clone 10H, BSA free, Tulip Biolabs) was diluted in 100 mL of PBS and desalted using 2ml Zeba desalting columns (Thermo scientific). 33 mg of desalted antibody was immobilized to the agarose resin. Adult male flies, expressing TDP-43 with elav-GAL4, were aged to day 4, a total of no more than 22 heads were homogenized for 1 min on ice in 200 mL of IP Lysis/wash buffer (Thermo Scientific), that was supplemented with cOmplete Mini EDTA-free inhibitor (Roche) and ADP-HPD (Calbiochem) at a final concentration of 1 mM. A total of 20 mL was removed for input. Samples were pre-cleared with agarose (1 hr with gentle shaking at 4C). Precleared lysate was incubated with the antibody-agarose resin at 4C for 14 hrs, then washed 3 times in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor and 1 mM ADP-HPD (10 mins each with rotation at 4C), and eluted in 50 mL of elution buffer. Samples for immunoblotting were prepared in 1X LDS sample buffer, heat denatured at 90C for 6 min and electrophoresed on a NuPAGE 4%\u201312% Bis-Tris gel. TDP-43 was detected using antiTDP-43 (1 in 250; Proteintech) and ECL Prime (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). COS-7 cells were lysed in IP Lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific) containing 1 mM ADP-HPD (Calbiochem) and cOmplete Mini EDTAfree inhibitor (Roche). Lysate was removed for input analysis and the remaining cell lysate was pre-cleared in either Agarose-G or dynabeadsTM protein G (both ThermoFisher Scientific) for 1 hr at 4C. 5 mg of anti-TDP-43 (Proteintech), 5 mg of anti-PAR (10H) BSA free (Tulip Biolabs) and 5 mg of anti-PAR (Enzo life sciences) were coupled to 50 ml of Agarose-G or dynabeadsTM protein G and incubated with the precleared lysate.

        "text": "Cell stress assays and immunofluorescence. COS-7 cells were seeded at an appropriate density onto glass coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine (neuVitro) in 24 well plates. The following day each well was transfected with 500 ng of plasmid DNA, 1.75 mL lipofectamine LTX and 0.5 mL PLUS reagent in 100 mL of OPTIMEM I (all ThermoFisher Scientific). For phosphorylation of the TDP-43-WT, TDP-43-C35 and TDP-43-C25 cells were transfected with lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific), all other transfections of Cos-7 cells used lipofectamine LTX. Again 500 ng of plasmid with 1.75 mL of lipofectamine 2000 were made up in 100 mL of OPTIMEM I and incubated at room temperature for 5 mins. All transfection mixtures were added to each well containing 400 mL of DMEM with high glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and no antibiotics. Transfection mixtures were left on overnight until the time of the experiment. All experiments begun 19-24 hr post-transfection. Cells were exposed to oxidative stress by incubating cells at 37C with 5% CO2 in either DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics or DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin-streptomycin and the indicated concentration of sodium arsenite (Sigma-Aldrich). For stress-resolution experiments, cells were exposed to 0.25 mM sodium arsenite for 1 hr and then washed with PBS twice and then incubated in pre-warmed DMEM with 10% FBS and antibiotics. See below for immunofluorescence details. For drug inhibitor assays, Cos-7 cells were grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected with lipofectamine LTX as described above. Transfection mixtures were not removed. Cells were incubated with 1 mM XAV-939 (SelleckChem), G007-LK (SelleckChem) in DMEM with high glucose and 10% FBS for 30 mins at 37C with 5% CO2 before the application stress. For IWR1-endo (SelleckChem) experiments, cells were incubated in either 0.5 mM, 1 mM or 10 mM of drug for 30 mins at 37C with 5% CO2 prior to stress. For all drugs, cells were exposed to 0.25 mM sodium arsenite in DMEM with high glucose and 10% FBS and the indicated amount of drug for 30 mins at 37C with 5% CO2. Experiments commenced 22-23 hr after transfection. See below for immunofluorescence see details. Primary cortical neurons, in 12-well plates, were cultured in neuralbasal medium with serum-free B-27 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and penicillin-streptomycin (ThermoFisher Scientific). Transfection was carried 6 DIV. Immediately before transfection the culture media was removed and cells were washed twice in pre-warmed PBS with calcium chloride and magnesium chloride (ThermoFisher). 1 ml of pre-warmed neuralbasal medium supplemented with B27 was added to each well. Transfection reactions were made up in a total of 200 mL of OPTIMEM I (ThermoFisher Scientific) and contained 500 ng or 1000 ng (both work well) of plasmid DNA and 2 mL of lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Transfection mixtures were left at room temperature for 5 minutes before being added to the well. The transfection media was removed after 6 hr, each well was washed twice with pre-warmed PBS with calcium chloride and magnesium chloride, and then the cells were returned to pre-warmed and conditioned neuralbasal media supplemented with serum-free B-27 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and penicillin-streptomycin (ThermoFisher Scientific). The neurons were stressed 10 DIV (4 days post-transfection). Transected neurons were stressed in 0.5 mM sodium arsenite for 90 min. See below for immunofluorescence see details. Neurons and COS-7 cells were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (made up in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl and 1 mM EGTA), permeablized by 3 sets of 3 mins in PEM-T buffer (100 mM PIPES, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA pH 6.8, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and blocked in 10% normal donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich) made up in TBST (TBS supplemented with 0.05% TWEEN 20 pH 8). Primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4C (see below for antibody details) in a humidified chamber, cells were washed 3 times in PEM-T buffer (3 mins each) and secondary antibody was applied for 45 mins (COS-7 cells) or 1 hr (neurons) at room temperature and in the dark. Cells were washed 3 times in TBST (3 mins each), cells were stained with Hoescht for 5 mins and coverslips were washed in deionized H20 immediately before mounting in prolong diamond.For detection of PAR, endogenous TDP-43 and Tankyrase in arsenite-induced stress granules, cells were washed twice in dPBS without magnesium and without calcium and extracted in 50 mM HEPES pH 6.8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 s before fixing. Cells were fixed for 15 mins in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in PEM-T (3 incubations, 3 mins each), then in 100 mM sodium periodate (Sigma-Aldrich) made up in PEM-T for 5 mins, washed in PEM-T for 3 mins, 25 mM succinic dihydrazide (Sigma-Aldrich) made up in PEM-T (30 mins), 3 washes in PEM-T (3 mins each) and then blocked in 10% normal donkey serum in TBST (TBS supplemented with 0.05 % TWEEN 20 pH 8) for 1 hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies used for both COS-7 and neurons: mouse anti-TIAR (1 in 500; BD Biosciences), mouse anti-Ataxin-2 (1 in 500; BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-G3BP1 (1 in 1000; Thermo Scientific), goat anti-eIF3 (1 in 50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-eIF3 (1 in 500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-TDP-43 (1 in 300, Proteintech), mouse anti-PAR (1 in 400: Tulip BioLabs), mouse anti PAR (1 in 400, ENZO), mouse pS409/10 (1 in 1000; Cosmo Bio USA) and rabbit pS409/10 (1 in 1000; Cosmo Bio USA). Alexa Fluor  488,  568,  594 and  647 secondary antibodies were used for detection (all 1 in 500; Thermo Scientific).

        "text": "PAR-binding dot blot assay. PAR-binding motifs were identified by aligning the PBM consensus to TDP-43 using the PATTINPROT search engine (Combet et al., 2000). For dot-blot analysis of recombinant protein, 0.25-0.5 mg of protein, diluted in 40 mM hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 20 mM reduced glutathione, was blotted onto 0.45 micron nitrocellulose membrane. Peptides, synthesized by GenScript (details are in the Key Resources Table and Figure 2), were spotted onto 0.1 micron nitrocellulose at 0.25-0.5 mg. Membranes were left to dry for 60-90 mins and then incubated in dPBS supplemented with 0.05% TWEEN20 (PBST) for 30 mins without agitation. The membrane was sealed in a hybridization bag (KPL) containing 0.4 mL of PBST containing 50nM PAR polymer (Trevigen) and incubated for 1 hr with rocking and rotation at room temperature. The membrane was washed 5 times in PBST (5 mins each) and blocked in PBSMT (5% milk in PBST) for 1 hr then incubated in primary antibody in PBST for 1 hr. After 5 washes in PBSMT (5 min each), the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody in PBSMT for 30 min. The membrane was washed 3 times in PBSMT, 2 times in PBST and 2 times in PBS (all 5 min each). ECL prime was used to detect secondary antibody.

        "text": "Liquid-droplet formation. His6-SUMO-TDP-43 was prepared in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM DTT, and 100 mg/mL dextran from Leuconostoc spp. (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with the indicated concentrations of NaCl. For TDP-43-MBP-His6, the protein was first buffer exchanged into 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and reactions were prepared in 20 mM HEPES, pH7.4, 1 mM DTT, 100 mg/mL dextran from Leuconostoc spp. (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with the appropriate concentration of NaCl. Protein was always added last to each LLPS reaction. Protein samples were spotted onto a coverslip and imaged by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. All movies and images were captured within ten minutes of reaction set-up. Details of experimental repeats are in the associated legends. To assess the effect of PAR on TDP-43 phase separation, SUMO-TDP-43 was prepared as before but with the addition of 5 microM mono-ADP- ribose equivalents of PAR (Trevigen) or equivalent volume of PAR control buffer (10 mM Tris, pH8 and 1mM EDTA). For SUMO-TDP-43 and PAR experiments, all movies and images were captured within ten min of reaction set up. For TDP-43-MBP-His6 with PAR or PAR control buffer, reactions were incubated at room temperature ( 19  22C) for 1 hr prior to imaging. The PAR nucleation studies of TDP-43 LLPS were repeated twice at the phase boundary. The comparison between full-length TDP-43 and TDP-43 with mutation in the PAR-binding motifs has been tested three times on two or more different protein preps. The comparison between full-length TDP-43 and the C-terminal fragments has been repeated on two independent protein preps. Testing the effect of PAR on the TDP-43-WT, TDP-43-DPBM and the two C-terminal fragments has been repeated on two independent protein preps. Experiments examining the phase boundary of TDP-43-MBP were performed 3-5 times and experiments analyzing PAR nucleation three times using one protein prep.

Mice were anesthetized and perfused via the ascending aorta with pre-cooled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 1 min and then with pre-cooled 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The brain and lumbar spinal cord were removed, and post-fixed in the same fixative for 6 h and then transferred to a solution of 0.1 M PBS containing 20% sucrose for 24 h. A series of coronal sections of the fixed tissues was prepared in paraffin-embedded slides. The paraffin was removed from the tissue by xylene immersion.

        "text": "Western blots. To identify CB1 and CB2 receptors, each sample containing 100 lg of spinal cord membrane protein was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide mini-gels. Prior to separation, samples were resuspended in 40 lL of electrophoresis loading buffer (0.065 mol/L Tris\u2013HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol), and heated at 90C for 2 min. The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method of immunoblotting was employed (GE Healthcare/ Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Gels were transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes and incubated overnight at 4C with 10% milk in blotting buffer (TBS-0.1%) (Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.6, 25 mmol/L; NaCl, 0.09%; Tween-20, 0.1%). Blots were then washed three times (5 min each) with TBS-0.1% and incubated with primary antibodies (1 : 200) overnight at 4C while shaking. For selected blots, the appropriate blocking peptide (1 : 100) was incubated with the respective primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature (25C) prior to incubation with blots. The primary antibody solutions were removed and blots washed as described previously. Secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase, 1 : 5000) was added and incubated for 4 h, with shaking. The secondary antibody was removed and blots washed as described. Blots were incubated for 1 min with equal volumes of ECL detection reagents 1 and 2. Chemiluminescence was captured for 2 h and saved as a TIFF file by a Flurochem 8900 MultiImage Light Cabinet (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA, USA). The captured images were digitized and the relative cannabinoid receptor levels compared after densitometry analysis (Scion NIH Image 1.63, NIH Freeware, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The relative protein levels were calculated by normalizing to actin immunoreactivity and subtracting the background intensity. The primary antibodies and blocking peptides for both the CB1 and CB2 receptors were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The CB1 receptor polyclonal antibody (Catalog No. 10006590) was raised against the C-terminal amino acids 461\u2013 472 of the human CB1 receptor. This antigen is identical to the corresponding sequence in murine, rat, canine and bovine species. The CB2 receptor polyclonal antibody (Catalog No. 101550) was raised against amino acids 20\u201333 in a sequence between the Nterminus and the first transmembrane domain of the protein of the human CB2 receptor. Human and murine CB2 receptors exhibit 82% homology at the amino acid level over the complete protein. CB1 (Catalog No. 10006591) and CB2 (Catalog No. 301550) blocking peptides were derived from the CB1 and CB2 receptor sequences used as antigens for production of the respective polyclonal antiserum.",

        "text": "[35S]GTPcS binding. [35S]GTPcS binding assays were performed as described previously (Prather et al. 2000a) in a buffer containing 20 mmol/L Hepes, 100 mmol/L NaCl, and 10 mmol/L MgCl2 at pH 7.4. Each binding reaction contained 10 lg of spinal cord membrane protein, the presence or absence of cannabinoid ligands (see the following), plus 0.1 nmol/L [35S]GTPcS (1250 Ci/mmol, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences) and 10 lmol/L of GDP to suppress basal Gprotein activation. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 30C. Nonspecific binding was defined by binding observed in the presence of 10 lmol/L of non-radioactive GTPcS. The reaction was terminated by rapid vacuum filtration through glass fiber filters followed by two washes with ice-cold assay buffer. About 4 mL of Scintiverse (Fisher Scientific) was added to the filters and radioactivity quantified by scintillation counting. Cannabinoid-mediated G-protein activation in spinal cord membranes was measured by selective antagonism of the [35S]GTPcS binding produced by a receptor-saturating concentration (100 nmol/ L) of the full, non-selective CB1/CB2 agonist HU-210. HU-210 binds with equivalent affinity to CB1 and CB2 receptors with an approximate Ki of 0.5 nmol/L (Felder et al. 1995; Breivogel et al. 2001). In these studies, we first determined the minimal concentration of the neutral CB1 antagonist O-2050 (Gardner and Mallet 2006) required to completely block CB1-mediated G-protein activation by HU-210. This was accomplished by antagonism experiments employing membranes prepared from mouse cortex as a relatively pure source of CB1 receptors. In these studies, it was determined that 3 lmol/L of O-2050 was the minimal concentration required to completely block HU-210-mediated (100 nmol/L) Gprotein activation by CB1 receptors in cortical membranes (data not shown). Next, the minimal concentration of the selective CB2 antagonist SR-144528 (Rinaldi-Carmona et al. 1998) required to completely block CB2-mediated G-protein activation by HU-210 was determined. This was accomplished by antagonism experiments employing membranes prepared from CHO\u2013CB2 cells (Shoemaker et al. 2005) as a pure source of CB2 receptors. In these studies, it was shown that 3 lmol/L of SR-144528 was the minimal concentration required to completely block HU-210-mediated (100 nmol/L) G-protein activation by CB2 receptors in CHO\u2013CB2 membranes (data not shown). Therefore, employing spinal cord membranes harvested from WT-OE and G93A mice, CB1-selective stimulation was defined as the amount of O-2050 (3 lmol/L) sensitive G-protein stimulation produced by HU-210 (100 nmol/L). CB2-selective activation was defined as the amount of SR-144528 (3 lmol/L) sensitive G-protein stimulation produced by HU-210 (100 nmol/L). The selective antagonism method described here was developed in response to many failed attempts to demonstrate consistent, measurable G-protein activation with the selective CB1 agonist ACEA (Hillard et al. 1999) or the CB2 agonists GW-405833 (Valenzano et al. 2005) and AM-1241 (Yao et al. 2006) in mouse spinal cord membranes (data not shown). While these observations were surprising for the full CB1 agonist ACEA (Hillard et al. 1999), both GW-405833 and AM-1241 have been reported to act as partial agonists in several in vitro assays (Valenzano et al. 2005; Yao et al. 2006). In any case, it is likely that the poor G-protein stimulation produced by partial agonists in the present study is due to less than optimal experimental conditions and/or a relatively low density of cannabinoid receptors expressed in spinal cord membranes, leading to reduced receptor-mediated responses.",

Two hundred microliters of cells (250 cells/L) was plated into 96-well black-well/clear bottom plates (Perkin Elmer, USA) using the Multidrop 384 (ThermoScientific, USA) automated cell plater. Cells were typically incubated for 1 h to allow attachment. For the US Drug Collection Library (MicroSource, USA) 0.5 L of 1 mM stock was added to each well giving a final concentration of 2.5 M. For dose\u2013response curves compounds were added to final concentrations of 25 M, 10 M, 2.5 M, 1 M, 0.25 M, 0.1 M, 0.025 M, 0.01 M, 0.0025 M, 0.001 M, 0.00025 M and 0.0001 M. In each case 0.5 L was added to each well of a 96-well plate using Biomek FX liquid handling platform (Beckman Coulter, USA). Cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 \u25e6C, conditions previously shown to give optimal assay conditions [3]. For measurements of GFP fluorescence, plates were washed in TBS, and then lysed with 200 l RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, 40 mM Tris\u2013HCl). Fluorescence levels were determined using the EnVision 2102Multilabel plate reader (Perkin Elmer, USA), excitation 485 nm, emission 535 nm. Compound toxicity analysis was gauged by determining levels of ATP, as a measure of cell viability, using the luminescence based Cell Titre-Glo assay (Promega, USA).

Rat embryos on embryonic day 15 were genotyped by PCR and cultures of SOD1G93A motor neurons and non-transgenic were carried out in parallel. Briefly, the dorsal horns of spinal cords were dissected and incubated in 0.05% trypsin for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C, followed by mechanical dissociation. Motor neurons were then purified by centrifugation on an Optiprep cushion, followed by isolation of p75NTR expressing motor neurons by immunoaffinity selection with the IgG 192 monoclonal antibody. Motor neuron cultures were plated at a density of 300 cells/cm2 in 24 well plates precoated with polyornithine and laminin and maintained in Neurobasal media supplemented with 2% horse serum, 25 \u03bcM Lglutamate, 25 \u03bcM 2-mercaptoethanol, 500 \u03bcM L-glutamine, and 2% B27 supplement at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere (Cassina et al., 2002; Henderson et al., 1995). Survival was maintained by the addition of GDNF (1 ng/ml). Two hours after plating apocynin or diapocynin were added from 200\u00d7 stock solutions prepared in DMSO and half an hour later DETANONOate (20 \u03bcM) was added to generate a low steady state concentration of nitric oxide (~100 nM). DETANONOate was resupplied after 24 h. Motor neuron survival was assessed after 48 h of treatment by counting all phase-bright cells with intact neurites longer than 4 body diameters in 2 diameters of the well. Values were expressed as percentage of the number of motor neurons present in control wells maintained with GDNF.",

Analyses were run in isocratic mode with methanol-acetonitrile (35:65) with 0.1% formic acid at 0.2 ml/min flow rate for 3 min. Multiple reaction monitoring analysis of two transitions was conducted for apocynin, 165.1-150.0 m/z, and diapocynin, 329.1\u2013313.1 m/z. The corresponding peaks were identified using Q1 full scan comparing retention times and mass spectra of apocynin and diapocynin with those obtained for the standards. Standards were prepared by spiking non-treated control tissue to account for observed matrix suppression at varying concentrations. Minor background noise in non-spiked non-treated control tissue was adjusted for in reported values of treated tissue.",

        "text": "Clinical assessment. Beginning at 6 weeks of age, mice were weighed and assessed using neurobehavioral tests (n = 15 animals in each group). Muscle strength and coordination deficits were evaluated weekly using a Rotarod apparatus (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) as previously described (Li et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2002). Testing was terminated either when the mice fell from the rod or at 7 min if the mouse remained on the rod. Disease onset was defined as the first day when the mouse could not remain on the Rotarod for 7 min at the speed of 15 rpm. Mortality was scored at the age of natural death or the age when the mouse was unable to right itself within 30 s (surrogate death). Three times per week, the mice were evaluated for signs of motor deficits according to a four-point neurological scoring system (Shefner et al., 2001; Veldink et al., 2003; Weydt et al., 2003): no sign of motor dysfunction (0); evident tremor and inability to extend hind limbs when suspended by the tail (1); paresis of one or both hind limbs and presence of gait abnormalities (2); paralysis of one or both hind limbs and gait with dragging of at least one hind limb (3); inability to right itself within 30 s (4). Body weight was monitored weekly. All studies were performed by investigators blinded to treatment.",

At 120 days of age, a separate cohort of mice (n = 5 animals in each group) was anesthetized, transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and spinal cords were harvested. After post-fixation and cryoprotection, serial sections of the frozen tissue were cut in the coronal plane at 50 \u03bcm intervals as described previously (Wang et al., 2007). Motor neuron survival was evaluated by Nissl staining. The absolute numbers of motor neurons with visible nucleoli were counted in the ventral horns of all sections from lumbar regions at the L2\u20133 level. The observer was blinded to the identity of each preparation. The numbers reported for each experimental group were average counts of motor neurons per section (including right and left ventral horns) among 20 continuous sections from each of five animals. The area of grey and white matter and the total cross-sectional area were also measured in the same Nissl-stained preparations of lumbar spinal cord using Spot RT Software (Diagnostic Instrument, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Subsequently, the volume per section was calculated as area \u00d7 thickness. An average volume per section was calculated for mice in each experimental group. In parallel experiments, serial sections of spinal cord were immunostained with antibodies specifically against cytochrome c (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA), activated caspase-3 (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), Ricinus communis agglutinin-1 (RCA-1, Sigma), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), or MT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, CA) respectively followed by conjugated secondary antibody as previously described (Ferrante et al., 1997; Ryu et al., 2005).",

Mice were sacrificed at the age of 120 days, and samples of total lysate and cytosolic fraction were prepared from spinal cords as described previously (Li et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2002). Briefly, for the samples of total protein lysates, tissue samples (mouse or human spinal cord specimens) were homogenized on ice in RIPA buffer (1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 142.5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and PMSF (0.1 mg/ml; Fluka, Switzerland). Lysates were centrifuged twice at 10,000 \u00d7g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. The resulting supernatants were analyzed by western blotting with antibodies to caspase-1, caspase-3, caspase-9, Rip2, MT1 and MT2. To prepare cytosolic fractions, tissue samples were gently homogenized in cold buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitor cocktail and 0.1 mg/ml PMSF) and clarified by a 700 \u00d7g centrifugation for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 15,000 \u00d7g for 25 min at 4 \u00b0C and used as the cytosolic component for the determination of released cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo by western blotting. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Proteins in total lysates or in cytosolic fractions (50\u2013100 \u03bcg) were resolved by electrophoresis on 12% or 15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Transfer membranes were probed using antibodies to caspase-1 (provided by Dr. Junying Yuan, Harvard Medical School), pro- or active caspases-3 and caspase-9 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), Rip-2 (\u03a8ProSci, Poway, CA), MT1 and MT2 (MBL, Woburn, MA), cytochrome c (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA), or Smac/Diablo (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO).

        "text": "Histological evaluation and stereological analysis. Mice were perfused transcardially with 0.1 M cold PBS for 1 min, followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. The spinal cords were dissected carefully, and the lumbar segment was identified using the ribs and the vertebrae as a guide. Tissues were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 6 h. Blocks were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 24 h. For stereological analysis, serial coronal sections (50 \u03bcm thick) were cut through the lumbar (L1\u2013L4) spinal cord enlargements from wild-type controls and vehicle-, lenalidomide-treated G93A mice and stained for Nissl substance using cresyl violet as described previously (n= 6) (Kiaei et al., 2005a). The optical fractionator method in the Stereo Investigator (v3.45) software program (Microbrightfield, Burlington, VT) was employed to obtain unbiased stereological counts of Nissl-stained neurons in the ventral horn of 10 serial non-adjacent sections (250 \u03bcm apart). Cell counts were made bilaterally within an area demarcated by a horizontal line drawn through the central canal and encompassing the ventral gray horn of the gray matter to include layers seven through nine. The size of the x-y sampling grid was 200 \u03bcm \u00d7 200 \u03bcm. The counting frame thickness was 14 \u03bcm with 3-\u03bcm guard zones. Neuronal counts are expressed as the means\u00b1 standard errors of the mean. A separate set of sections was collected as free-floating sections and processed for immunohistochemistry. The sections were immunostained with antibodies to TNF- (Peprotech, NJ), FasL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), CD40 (Serotec, Oxford, UK), and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP; Dako, Carpinteria, CA), using a modified avidin\u2013biotin\u2013peroxidase technique. The immuno reaction was visualized using 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride dihydrate with nickel intensification (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as the chromogen. The sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides, dehydrated, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped. The specificity of immunostaining was confirmed by omission of the primary antibody.",

Each mouse was placed in the headup position on the wooden board inclined at each angle and had to maintain this position for 5 seconds without falling. For evaluation of the inclined plane test, the number of seconds (TA: 5 seconds or less) during which the position was maintained by the mouse without falling was measured at each of the angles (A), and then the sum of the product of the angle (A) and the number of seconds (TA) during which the position could be maintained on the board at angle A:R [Angle(A)  Time (TA)] was calculated. Because a normal mouse is capable of maintaining the position on the board at each of the angles for 5 seconds, the calculated value of R [Angle(A)  Time (TA)] for such a mouse having normal function would be 80  5 \u00fe 65  5 \u00fe 45  5 \u00bc 950.

A score of 2 was assigned to dead animals in order to include them in the statistical analysis.",

Sections were deparaffinized and endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation for 30 minutes with 0.3% H2O2. The sections were then washed in PBS. Normal serum homologous with the secondary antibodies was used for blocking. Sections were incubated with the primary antibodies for 18 hours at 4 C or with PBS as the control. Bound antibodies were visualized by the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase complex (ABC) method using the appropriate Vectastain ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and 3,30 - diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride ([DAB] Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) as the chromogen. Some of the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For the immunostaining for SOD1, mouse monoclonal antibody against human SOD1 (0.5 mg/ml, clone 1G2, MBL, Aichi, Japan) was used as a primary antibody.

        "text": "Glutamate uptake assays. Uptake studies in synaptosomes were performed with synaptosomal P2 fractions isolated from cervical spinal cord or the specified brain regions. L-[ 3 H]Glutamate uptake was assayed in a final volume of 250  l of HBS containing 75  g of synaptosomal protein, 1  M L-glutamate, and 0.25  Ci/assay L-[ 3 H]glutamate in the absence and presence of inhibitors for the determination of IC50 values. Kinetic experiments were undertaken in the presence of 1\u201330  M L-glutamate in the presence of 0.25 Ci/assay L-[ 3 H]glutamate as tracer. The effect of riluzole was evaluated by preincubating synaptosomes with the indicated concentrations for 10 min, followed by measurement of L-[ 3 H]glutamate uptake, as described above for the inhibitors, in the continued presence of riluzole. Reactions were incubated for 4 min at room temperature and then terminated by filtration using a Packard Filtermate 96-well harvester, followed by rapid washing with ice-cold Na -free HBS (prepared by equimolar replacement with choline). Radioactivity retained on the filters was determined by scintillation counting. In all uptake experiments, the radioactivity retained after incubation in Na -free HBS was used to correct all data to represent Na - dependent uptake",

        "text": "2.3. Paw Grip Endurance and Rotarod Testing. Hind limb strength was assessed by paw grip endurance (PaGE) testing twice per week beginning at disease onset. Briefly, mice were placed on top of a standard wire cage lid which was suspended a few inches above the bench top. Mice were briefly allowed to acclimate before the cage lid was smoothly inverted to prompt the mouse to grip the wire with both its fore and hind limbs. A stopwatch was started as soon as the cage lid was inverted and the time was measured to determine how long the mouse could hold on before its hind legs released their grip from the cage lid, expressed as latency to fall. Care was taken not to jostle the lid during this time. The stopwatch was stopped at a maximum of 30s. Mice were given five scored attempts and the highest and lowest scores were excluded from the final score. Final scores are reported as an average of the three remaining scored attempts \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) for each time point. Time points correspond to the age of the animal at the time that testing was performed and are reported as a range of several days since multiple sets of animals having slightly different ages were tested concomitantly. Motor function and endurance were assessed by accelerating rotarod testing once per week beginning at disease onset. Mice were placed on a rod, 30 mm in diameter, rotating at 4 rpm. Each animal was placed in one lane and subjected to three trials. The lane was cleaned before the next mouse was tested to prevent interference. Once the mice were acclimated to the initial speed of 4 rpm, the rod was accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm over the course of 5 min. The time was stopped when the mouse fell off the rotating rod, expressed as latency to fall. Mice were given three scored attempts reported as an average \u00b1 SEM for each time point. Time points correspond to the age of the animal at the time that testing was performed and are reported as a range of several days since multiple sets of animals having slightly different ages were tested concomitantly.",

Stained for Iba-1 and GFAP at End Stage of the Untreated hSOD1G93A Littermate Mouse Tissue was imaged using a Zeiss Axio Observer epifluorescence microscope to capture a single image of each ventral horn on the 20\u00d7 objective. Imaging was performed by blinded researchers. For Iba-1 and GFAP, images were captured on the Alexa Fluor 488 channel and the exposure time was set appropriately for the untreated hSOD1G93A littermate and kept constant when imaging the PCAtreated hSOD1G93A and WT littermate mice. At least 6 ventral horns per animal were imaged and analyzed for fluorescence intensity using Adobe Photoshop CC software for both Iba-1 and GFAP staining. For both Iba-1 and GFAP quantification, the ventral horn image of the untreated hSOD1G93A littermate control mouse with the most background was chosen, and the green channel input level was adjusted so that background staining was best eliminated. This value was recorded and used for each subsequent image, including those taken from the WT control littermate and the PCA-treated hSOD1G93A littermate mice such that all images were adjusted by an equivalent amount. After the channel levels were adjusted, the ventral horn was outlined using the lasso tool and green channel values for mean pixel intensity and pixel area were recorded for each ventral horn image. Total pixel intensity of the green channel was obtained by multiplying the pixel intensity and pixel area. An average of the total pixel intensity was taken for each mouse. Quantification was performed twice by two different and blinded researchers. An average of the pixel intensities for each mouse was obtained. For analysis, the average total pixel intensity for the WT littermate control mouse for each group was set at 100% and the average total pixel intensities for the untreated hSOD1G93A littermate control and PCA-treated hSOD1G93A littermate mice were calculated as percentages relative to the WT littermate control mouse. Mean raw GFAP and Iba-1 fluorescence intensity in the lumbar spinal cord ventral horn in the untreated hSOD1G93A littermate mice and WT littermate mice were also counted and statistically compared to verify a significant disease effect.",

At least six ventral horns for each mouse were imaged. Any neuron greater than 20 \u03bcm in length along its longest axis was considered to be a viable alpha motor neuron. Using Adobe Photoshop CC, the contrast was set to the WT littermate and kept the same within the group to ensure consistency in staining.

        "text": "2.15. Imaging of Quantification of 4-HNE-Stained Spinal Cord Sections at 105 Days of Age. A single image of each ventral horn on the 20\u00d7 objective was captured for each mouse. Imaging was performed by blinded researchers. Images were captured on the Alexa Fluor 488 channel (pseudo-colored red) and the exposure time was set appropriately for the untreated hSOD1G93A littermate and kept constant when imaging the PCA-treated hSOD1G93A and WT littermate mice. Two littermate groups were analyzed and 6 ventral horns per animal were imaged and analyzed for fluorescence intensity using Adobe Photoshop CC software. The ventral horn image of the untreated hSOD1G93A littermate control mouse with the most background was chosen, and the red channel input level was adjusted so that background staining was best eliminated. This value was recorded and used for each subsequent image, including those taken from the WT control littermate and the PCA-treated hSOD1G93A littermate mice such that all images were adjusted by an equivalent amount. After the channel levels were adjusted, the ventral horn was outlined using the lasso tool and red channel values for mean pixel intensity and pixel area were recorded for each ventral horn image. Total pixel intensity of the red channel was obtained by multiplying the pixel intensity and pixel area. An average of the total pixel intensity was taken for each mouse. Quantification was performed once by a blinded researcher. An average of the pixel intensities for each mouse was obtained. For analysis, the average total pixel intensity for the WT littermate control mouse for each group was set at 100% and each individual total pixel intensity for each ventral horn for the untreated hSOD1G93A littermate control and PCA-treated hSOD1G93A littermate mice were calculated as percentages relative to the average total pixel intensity of the WT littermate control mouse. Mean raw 4-HNE fluorescence intensity in the lumbar spinal cord ventral horn in the untreated hSOD1G93A littermate mice and WT littermate mice were also counted and statistically compared to verify a significant disease effect.",

        "text": "Genome-wide transcript profiling. We performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling using Affymetrix MOE430vII gene chips. In the SOD1G93A preclinical model, symptom onset is first seen as abnormal hindlimb splay reflex starting at approximately day 75 with progressive paralysis in the hindlimbs, then forelimbs and finally diaphragm. In the longitudinal study design, we collected spinal cord, calf muscle, brain, sciatic nerve, whole blood and adipose from SOD1G93A animals and wild-type littermates at days 50, 60, 80, 90, 100, 110 and 120. For each time point, five non-transgenic and five SOD1G93A tissues were collected and processed independently, for a total of 70 tissues. We euthanized animals according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols at the time points described above, and immediately harvested tissues and snap-froze them in liquid nitrogen. We stored frozen tissues \u221280 \u00b0C. We processed all tissues simultaneously to purify total RNA using the Qiagen RNeasy kit as described by the manufacturer. We amplified total RNA using standard T7 linear amplification, incorporating a biotinylated nucleotide with the Nugen Ovation Amplification System. We fragmented labeled probe and hybridized it to MOE430vII mouse Affymetrix gene chips according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. We washed gene chips in an Affymetrix Genechip Fluids Station 450 to remove nonhybridized probe and scanned them in an Affymetrix 3000 7g scanner. We performed all computational processing and modeling using the R development language version 2.8 from Bioconductor. We used robust multi-array averaging for data preprocessing and normalization using the Bioconductor vignette Affy. We assessed the statistical differences in gene expression between SOD1G93A and wild-type tissues, at a given time point, using the nonlinear Bayes methodology in the Bioconductor LIMMA package. We identified pathways that statistically changed during disease progression using the Bioconductor vignette GlobalTest. We calculated Q scores and P values for each molecular pathway in the Kegg and Biocarta databases by comparing the differences in expression between the SOD1G93A and non-transgenic genotypes in each tissue at each time point in the longitudinal study design. The GlobalTest method facilitates the hypothesis testing for the changes in gene expression for a group of genes being correlated with a specific sample attribute, such as clinical outcome or genotype. The score Q is a measurement of the correlation between the covariance matrices for the gene expression changes for a group of genes, compared to the covariance matrix of the sample attributes or groups. We calculated and plotted the distribution of Q scores for the longitudinal study design for each tissue, comparing the SOD1G93A and non-transgenic genotypes. To assess statistical significance of the change in Q score for each tissue at any given time point, we recalculated the Q scores for each longitudinal tissue set after sample randomization between the two genotypes at each time point for each tissue set. We created an interaction network in Cytoscape 2.6 reflecting the relationships between the molecular pathways for each tissue as well as the genes that define each molecular pathway. We overlaid the Q scores and gene expression values for each gene in each tissue for the longitudinal study onto the nodes of the network in Cytoscape.",

The anti-mouse CD4-PerCP conjugate was from Beckman Dickinson Biosciences, as follows: clone, GK1.5; isotype, rat (Lewis) IgG2b\u03ba; immunogen, cloned mouse CTL line V4; specificity, CD4/L3T4, Mr 52 kDa. The anti-mouse CD8-PE conjugate was from Becton-Dickinson Biosciences, as follows: clone, 53-6.7; isotype, rat (LOU/Ws1/M) IgG2a\u03ba; specificity, \u03b1 chain of the mouse CD8 heterodimer, Mr 32-34 kDa. We performed compensation on single-channel controls mixed 1:1 with unstained controls. We set gates for PerCP and PE after identifying the lymphocyte population by side- and forward-scatter characteristics. Quartile frequencies for Figure 5 were as follows. Untreated non-transgenic sciatic lymph node (Fig. 5d): Q1, Cd8+/Cd4\u2212, 37.0%; Q2, Cd8+/Cd4+, 0.8%; Q3, Cd8\u2212/Cd4+, 51.0%; Q4, Cd8\u2212/Cd4\u2212, 11.2%. Untreated SOD1 sciatic lymph nodes (Fig. 5e): Q1, Cd8+/Cd4\u2212, 29.5%; Q2, Cd8+/Cd4+, 0.6%; Q3, Cd8\u2212/Cd4+, 54.2%; Q4, Cd8\u2212/Cd4\u2212, 15.7%. Anti-Cd40lg\u2013treated SOD1 sciatic lymph nodes (Fig. 5f): Q1, Cd8+/Cd4\u2212, 14.5%; Q2, Cd8+/Cd4+, 1.6%; Q3, Cd8\u2212/Cd4+, 56.1%; Q4, Cd8\u2212/Cd4\u2212, 27.8%.",

        "text": "Analysis of Motor Neuron Survival in the Spinal Cord. After transcardial perfusion with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA), the lumbar spinal cord was dissected and postfixed overnight in 4% PFA, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose at 4 \u00b0C, and then embedded in OCT and sectioned on a Thermo-Fisher cryostat (HM550) at 30-\u03bcm thickness. Every seventh section was immunohistochemically stained with goat anticholine acetyltransferase (anti-ChAT) (Millipore). Briefly, sections were incubated in 1% H2O2 for 45 min at room temperature, rinsed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and treated with 0.1% Triton-TBS and then blocked for 60 min in 3% BSA, 5% donkey serum, 0.3% Triton-100 in TBS. Sections were then incubated in goat anti-ChAT (1:100) in the same blocking solution overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The next day, sections were rinsed in TBS and incubated with donkey anti-goat biotin (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Signal was amplified with an ABC kit from Vector Labs, and diaminobenzidine was used as a chromagen. Immunostained tissue was then photographed at 4\u00d7 using a Nikon Eclipse 90i motorized microscope, and the number of ChAT-positive neurons was counted in a blinded manner by two investigators, followed by normalization for ventral horn volume.",

The distal tendons of the right TA and EDL muscles were dissected free from surrounding tissue, individually tied with 4.0 braided surgical silk (Interfocus) and cut at their distal ends. The sciatic nerve was then exposed and all its branches cut except the common peroneal nerve (CPN), which innervates the TA and EDL muscles. The mouse was placed on a thermopad (Harvard Apparatus) to maintain body temperature at 37uC. The right foot was secured to a platform and the knee immobilized using a stainless steel pin. The TA and EDL muscle tendons were then individually attached to a strain gauge (Dynamometer, UFI Devices) to record muscle twitch forces. Isometric twitch contractions were elicited by stimulating the distal part of the DPN via bipolar silver electrodes using square wave pulses of 0.02 ms. Force output from the strain gauge was recorded using an analogue to digital converter interfaced with a computer running the appropriate software (Cambridge Electronics Design Ltd). The stimulation voltage and subsequently the length of the muscle were adjusted to produce the maximum isometric twitch force. The stimulus amplitude was then set to 0 V and manually increased over a range of 10 V, which resulted in discrete increments in twitch force due to the successive recruitment of motor units. With each increment in force, the stimulus amplitude was held at constant voltage for at least 5 stimuli and then increased manually until a larger twitch was generated. This procedure was repeated until there was no further increase in force, indicating that all motor units were recruited. The number of step-wise increments of force was counted for both control and metformin-treated mice in a blinded fashion and taken as an estimate of the number of motor units in the TA and EDL muscles.",

        "text": " Analysis of disease progression and survival. Neurological scores for both hind limbs were assessed twice weekly for each mouse from 41 days of age. Neurological scores were assigned using a scale of 0\u20134 developed by the ALSTDI through detailed observations of SOD1G93A mouse pathology [22,29,30]. Criteria used to assign each score level were: 0 - Full extension of hind legs away from lateral midline when mouse is suspended by its tail and mouse can hold this for 2 seconds, suspended 2\u20133 times. 1 - Collapse or partial collapse of leg extension towards lateral midline (weakness) or trembling of hind legs during tail suspension. 2 - Toes curl under at least twice during walking of 12 inches or any part of foot is dragging along cage bottom (a clean cage containing no bedding was used for this analysis to permit easy viewing of the toes). 3 - Rigid paralysis or minimal joint movement, foot not being used for forward motion. 4 - Mouse cannot right itself within 30 s from one or both of its sides (this test was performed in a clean cage containing the same type and amount of bedding as present in the mouse\u2019s home cage). Body weight for all mice was measured twice weekly from 35 days of age. This provided an additional, non-invasive, measure of disease onset and progression and also allowed monitoring of the general health of the mice. Weight-loss in high copy SOD1G93A mice is normally a gradual process that begins at approximately 90 days of age and continues until death. Rapid losses of weight over a short number of days that do not fit the normal pattern can therefore be indicative of non-ALS related or drug-induced maladies [22]. For humane reasons, a uniform end point of the inability of a mouse to right itself within 30 s of being placed on a side (neurological score 4) was employed for all mice. From 100 days of age, the righting reflex of each mouse from each side was tested twice daily to ensure that the end point of each mouse was accurately determined. Once mice reached their end point, they were euthanized via cervical dislocation and the date and cause of their death was recorded.",

For scoring axons from transgenic mFUS and mTDP-43 worms, synchronized animals were selected at days 1, 5 and 9 of adulthood for visualization of motor neurons in vivo with the unc-47p::GFP transgenic reporter. Animals were immobilized in M9 with 5 mM levamisole and mounted on slides with 2% agarose pads. Motor neurons were visualized with a Leica CTR 6000 and a Leica DFC 480 camera. A minimum of 100 animals was scored per treatment over 4\u20136 trials. Animals showing gaps or breaks along motor neuron processes were scored as positive for the degeneration phenotype. The mean and SEM were calculated for each trial and two-tailed t-tests were used for statistical analysis. For visualization of fluorescence after treatment with dihydrofluorescein diacetate, L4 animals were grown on NGM plates or NGM plates with methylene blue and examined for fluorescence with the Leica system described above",

Fluorescent images of fixed embryos were taken using a Quorum Technologies spinning-disk confocal microscope mounted on an upright Olympus BX61W1 fluorescence microscope equipped with an Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera. Image acquisition was performed with Volocity software (PerkinElmer). As previously described [16], axonal projections from primary and secondary motor neurons at a defined location in the inter somitic segments were determined. Analysis of Z-stacks by confocal microscopy was performed in three to four axonal projections per animal. The axonal length to the first branching (UAL) was determined by tracing the labeled axon from the spinal cord to the point where it branches using ImageJ (NIH). These values were averaged for each of the animal analyzed (10\u201330 zebrafish per condition) for the various conditions in our study.",

For in vivo detection of reactive oxygen species, live 2 day old embryos (2 dpf) were incubated in 5 mM 29,79-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 minutes at 28.5uC and washed three times for 5 min with embryo media. Fluorescence was observed under a 488 nm wavelength excitation. The generation of reactive oxygen species in the larvae exposed to the chemicals was also quantitatively assessed as described elsewhere [35]. Briefly, 15 embryos were washed with cold Phosphate Buffer solution (PBS; pH 7.4) twice and then homogenized in cold buffer (0.32 mM of sucrose, 20 mM of HEPES, 1 mM of MgCl2, and 0.5 mM of phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride (PMSF), pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,0006 g at 4uC for 20 min, and the supernatant was transferred to new tubes for further experimentation. Twenty microliters of the homogenate was added to a 96- well plate and incubated at room temperature for 5 min, after which 100 ml of PBS (pH 7.4) and 8.3 ml of DFH stock solution (10 mg/ml) were added to each well. The plate was incubated at 37uC for 30 minutes. The fluorescence intensity was measured using a microplate reader (SpectraMax M2, Molecular Device, Union City, CA, USA) with excitation and emission at 485 and 530 nm, respectively. The reactive oxygen species concentration was expressed as arbitrary emission units per mg protein.",

        "text": "Histochemistry of spinal cords. A parallel group of female G93A rats untreated (n = 5) and treated (n = 5) with 30 mM tempol in the drinking water and wildtype littermates (n = 5) was used for the stereological analysis of spinal cords. At the middle symptomatic phase of the G93A rats (115\u2013120 days), the animals were anesthetized with ketamine (20 mg/kg) and xylazine (1.5 mg/kg) and the euthanasia conducted with an overdose of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg). The animals were perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 2% heparin and 0.1% sodium nitrite followed by fixative solution of 4% formaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS. The lumbar spinal cords (L1\u2013L6) were identified, removed en bloc and its length measured using a digital pachymeter (Digimess). Subsequently, lumbar spinal cords were immersed in the same fixative solution for at least 72 hs, embedded in a 10% agar solution and sectioned with a nominal thickness of 40 mm using a VT1000S Leica vibratome. The sections were stained with 1% toluidine blue or used for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry [35]. Lumbar spinal cord vibrosections for immunohistochemistry were washed with PBS, incubated with a 0.3% Triton X-100 solution, exposed to 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in distilled water to block endogenous peroxidases, placed in a 10% non-immune normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs), incubated with a primary antibody (rabbit anti-ChAT, 1:1000, Abcam) and with a secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate, 1:200, KPL) in PBS. Immunoreactivity was visualised with 3,39- diaminobenzidine in PBS containing 0.01% hydrogen peroxide. Routine immunolabelling controls were carried out by omitting the primary or secondary antibody steps, independently (for more details, see [36]). Stained and immunolabelled sections were collected onto glass, washed in PBS, dehydrated in progressive ethanol concentrations and mounted under a coverslip with a drop of DPX (Fluka). Section images were acquired using a DMR Leica microscope equipped with a High-End DP 72 Olympus digital camera and projected onto a flat computer monitor. Stereological analyses were performed using the optical-disector and the rotator procedures of the newCAST Visiopharm stereology system version 4.2.8.0.",

        "text": "Stereological analysis of spinal cords. The total volumes of white and grey matter, ventral horn and lumbar spinal cord were estimated by means of the Cavalieri principle [37,38] in the same reference sections stained with toluidine blue used for disectors. Section profile areas were estimated from the numbers of randomly-positioned test points (,200 per compartment: white matter, grey matter and ventral horn) hitting the whole reference space and the areal equivalent of a test point. The total volumes of each compartment were obtained using the following formula V : = T. gACOMP, where T is the between-section distance (2,200 mm) and gACOMP is the sum of the delineated profile areas of the chosen set of lumbar spinal cord compartments\u2019 sections. The volume of lumbar spinal cord was calculated by the summing the volumes of white matter and grey matter. Irrespective of groups, the mean volume shrinkage (coefficient of variation, CV, expressed as a decimal fraction of the mean) was estimated to be 2.9% (0.19) in the wildtype group, 2.1% (0.15) in the untreated G93A group and 2.2% (0.16) in the treated G93A group. No correction for global shrinkage was performed since between-group differences were not significant (p = 0.21). The optical fractionator was used for estimating the total number of toluidine blue-stained (NTB) and ChAT positive (NChAT) neurons in spinal cord ventral horn [35,39,40]. Before starting the counting procedure, a z-axis distribution (calibration) was performed to determine the neuron distribution throughout section thickness and establish the disector height, which was 15 mm in the wild-type, 20 mm in the G93A untreated and treated group for both toluidine blue-stained and ChAT-positive neurons. Section thickness was measured in every field of view using the central point on the unbiased counting frame. The mean height sampling fraction (hsf) was 3/8 for toluidine blue-stained and for ChAT-positive neurons in the wildtype group and 1/2 for toluidine blue-stained and for ChATpositive neurons in the untreated and treated G93A group. The perikaryon was defined as the counting unit. For all groups, a mean area sampling fraction (asf) of 1/7 for toluidine blue-stained and 1/6 for ChAT-positive neurons of the chosen sections was sampled using 2-D unbiased counting frames with a frame area equivalent to 10,000 mm2 [41]. For toluidine blue-stained neurons an average of 125 disectors were used to count 194 neurons (gQ2) in the wild-type group. In the untreated G93A group, 113 disectors were applied to count 124 neurons and, in the treated G93A group, 115 disectors were applied to count 219 neurons. For ChAT-positive neurons an average of 97 disectors were used to count 187 neurons (gQ2) in the wild-type group. In the untreated G93A group, 119 disectors were applied to count 107 neurons and, in the treated G93A group, 153 disectors were applied to count 234 neurons. The total number of toluidine bluestained and ChAT-positive neurons was then estimated by multiplying the counted number of particles - neurons in this case - by the reciprocal of sampling fractions: NTB or ChAT: = ssf 21 . hsf 21. asf 21. SQ2, where ssf is the mean section sampling fraction, hsf is the mean height sampling fraction, asf is the mean area sampling fraction and SQ2 is the total number of particles counted using optical disectors. The mean neuronal volume of toluidine blue-stained and ChAT-positive neurons was estimated by the planar rotator [35,38,42], which is a local and direct estimator of particle volume. The planar rotator method was computer assisted using the 6 half-line rotator probe available in the new CAST Visiopharm stereology system (version 4.2.8.0) and in the same reference sections used for total number estimation.",

        "text": "Detection of unfolded hSOD1 in spinal cord homogenates. Unfolded hSOD1 forms were detected with a conformationalspecific antibody (USOD) targeted against hSOD1 residues 42\u201348, which recognizes the presence of hSOD1 with an unfolded beta barrel [49,50]. This antibody was generously provided to us by Drs. Avijit Chakrabartty and Aaron Kerman from the University of Toronto, Canada. An aliquot of the homogenates, which were obtained as described above, was incubated at a concentration of approximately 6 mg/ml in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM DTPA, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin 2 mg/ml leupeptin and 2 mg/ml pepstatin) for 15 min at room temperature with mild shaking. After the incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 15000 g for 15 min at 4uC, the supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was determined with the Bradford method using a Bio-Rad Kit. Then, 2 mg of protein was incubated with 2 mg of affinity-purified USOD antibody and 50 ml of 50% Protein A-Agarose (Upstate) in RIPA buffer (750 ml final volume) overnight at 4uC. After the incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min. The pellet was washed 3 times with cold RIPA buffer, eluted with Laemmli\u2019s buffer, incubated for 5 min at 100uC, resolved by 15% SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane, which was blocked in 5% milk-TBS and then incubated with a primary antibody (sheep anti-hSOD, 1:2000, Calbiochem) and a secondary antibody (anti-sheep IgG peroxidase conjugate, 1:3000, Calbiochem) in 1% milk-TBST. A separate blot loaded with the supernatants from each sample (20 mg of protein) was performed as a loading control. The immunoreactivity was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce, USA) and the relative quantification was performed by densitometry (ImageJ, NIH, USA).",

        "text": "Balance beam. To assess balance and motor coordination,animals were trained to walk along an 80 cm-long wooden beamelevated 50 cm above bench surface and angled upwards. The animals traverse the beam in order to reach a dark enclosed escapebox placed on a platform. Each mouse was tested on 3 different beams of decreasing diameter and increasing difficulty (large24 mm, medium 19 mm, and small 11 mm).Between 11\u201313 weeks of age, all mice were trained using the largest beam. Each mouse was first placed in the escape box forabout 1 minute, then placed at the start end of the beam. Micehave a natural tendency to run upwards along the beam toward the escape box. Mice were given 8 trials over 2 days (4 consecutivetrials/day) with a maximum latency of 3 minutes. If an animalpaused on the beam or tried to turn and advance the wrong way, itwas gently touched on the hindquarters or tail and encouraged tokeep moving toward the escape box, or it was placed back at thebeginning and allowed to start the trial again. Between eachanimal, the beam was thoroughly cleaned with soap and waterfollowed by 70% isopropanol.At 17 weeks of age, all mice were assessed on the balance beamin a single test session consisting of 3 consecutive trials on each ofthe 3 different sized beams. The latency to reach the escape boxwas recorded, along with the number of missteps (foot slipping offthe beam). Mice were not allowed to start a trial over. If they felloff the beam, the timer was paused and they were replaced on thebeam at the position where they had fallen. At least one fall on one beam occurred for n =27 vehicle mice and n =22 erlotinib mice.If a mouse paused for over 20 s it was encouraged to keep movingby a gentle touch on the tail or the hindquarters. The experimentwas video recorded. Scoring was done live by one experimenterand also post-hoc by another experimenter using the videorecording. Both experimenters were blind to treatment. Asa reference for the level of difficulty of this task for a healthyage-matched littermate, examples of SOD WT data are shown inFigure S1.",

Female 129SvSOD1G93A mice were treated by oral gavage with ubiquinone10 orubiquinol10 (800mg/kg), or vehicle (n =15 each group). Thetreatment started when the mice were 13 weeks old, which is themean age that the growth of their body weight starts to differentiate from that of non-transgenic littermates and theyshow first alterations of hindlimbs abduction when raised by tail.This occurs just before the appearance of motor impairments(onset of motor deficit). Mice were treated daily until the end-stageof the disease, when they were sacrificed (see below).Disease progression was assessed two times a week from the startof the experiment by an operator blinded to the treatment. Theparameters included body weight, latency on rotating bar (rotarod)and paw grip endurance (PaGE) and were evaluated as previouslydescribed [17]. The motor symptoms onset was determined by thefirst impairment in grip strength or on rotarod performance for two consecutive time points. The mice were sacrificed when theywere unable to right themselves within 10 seconds after beingplaced on both sides. This time point was considered as the endstageof the disease and was used to estimate the survival time.Statistical analysis of the data of body weight, grip strength androtarod performance was carried out by Two-way ANOVA forrepeated measures (time) and different groups (treatments),followed by post-hoc Bonferroni\u2019s test to compare the effect of treatments in respect to vehicle at each time point.

Cell death was determined by an abrupt loss of fluorescence, indicating shrinkage or disappearance of the cell body. The time of death for each neuron was considered the last time that the neuron was present. Kaplan-Meier and cumulative risk of death curves were generated in R. Statistical significance of survival differences between cohorts of neurons is determined by the log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards analysis used to measure the relative change in the risk of death attributed to various experimental conditions.",

        "text": "Preparations of EDL Muscle for in situ Analysis. In situ muscle testing in a cohort of female mice occurred at twostages of disease: at 90\u2013100 days of age, when signs of weaknesswere becoming apparent (weakness and trembling of hindlimbs)and a later stage, 110\u2013115 days where signs of single or dual limbparalysis were evident. Mice were placed under anesthesia usingisoflurane and the skin around the experimental leg was removed.The distal end of the EDL muscle and its associated tendon werethen isolated. The mouse was placed on the platform of an Aurorain situ muscle analysis apparatus (model 806C; Aurora Scientific,Inc., Aurora, Ontario, Canada). Body temperature was maintainedwith a circulating water system. The knee was immobilizedin a clamp between two sharpened screws and the distal tendonwas cut and tied to the arm of a force transducer (AuroraScientific, Ontario, Canada) using a silk suture. The muscle wasstimulated via the peroneal nerve. For nerve isolation, a 0.5 cmincision was made at the upper thigh and the overlying bicepsfemoris muscle was cut to expose the peroneal nerve. The nervewas then dissected free of surrounding connective tissue and a pairof stainless steel needle electrodes (0.10 mm) were placed on theexposed nerve.Muscle contractile properties were assessed by recording theforce generated following stimulation of the peroneal nerve.Muscle length (Lo) was adjusted to produce the maximumisometric force after sub-maximal stimulation (30 Hz, 1 ms pulses,350 ms train duration). Once Lo had been established, the nervewas stimulated every 2 minutes at a selected frequency rangingfrom 10\u2013200 Hz (1 ms pulses, 350 ms train duration). To measurerelative changes in the force-frequency relationship followingtirasemtiv dosing, the muscle was stimulated at 5 Hz for the courseof the experiment. Twitch force was the force of a single stimuluscontraction-relaxation sequence measured at 10 Hz stimulus.Excessive tissue drying was alleviated by periodically drippingKrebs buffer (117.5 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4,1.18 mM MgSO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 25 mM NaHCO3, 11 mMglucose) onto the exposed muscle. This preparation was stable for3\u20134 hours.Tirasemtiv was administered in solution (50% PEG300/10%EtOH/40% Cavitron cyclodextrin formulation) as a single slowbolus over a 2 minute period via a catheter in the contralateralfemoral artery placed above the aortic bifurcation. Tirasemtiv bolusinjections (2, 2, 2, and 4 mg/kg) were given at approximately20 min intervals to achieve a cumulative dose of 10 mg/kg in order to assess the dose response, with a maximal dosage volumeof 5 ml/kg. At the end of each experiment, a single terminal bloodsample was drawn via cardiac puncture for compound concentrationanalysis. Muscles were excised, the length and weight of themuscle measured, and the force was normalized to the physiologicalcross sectional area of the muscle (N/cm2, described in (8).Metrics measured from these experiments included stimulated andbaseline tension.",

The different doses were structured to achieve comparable plasma levels in the different sex mice. Micewere weighed and assessed for clinical signs once per week using ascoring system composed of three metrics: Gait, balance andability to ambulate, each scored on a five point scale by the investigator during the course of the study. Once muscle weaknesswas evident, animals were weighed and scored more frequentlybased on the severity of weakness. Humane endpoints used todetermine time of euthanasia included weight loss of greater than20%, dual limb (hind limb or forelimb) paralysis or a lowexpectation of survival until the next time point. Investigators judging animal viability were blinded to whether or not animalswere being treated with control chow or tirasemtiv-formulatedchow. The median age of survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method for the vehicle control and tirasemtiv-treated micerespectively.

SOD1-G93A mice on the C57BL/6 background exhibitdelayed onset of clinical symptoms and extended lifespan as compared to the commonly usedB6SJL hybrid strain [40], although the overall duration of disease is unchanged. Study animalswere generated by backcrossing male B6.Cg-Tg (SOD1 G93A)1Gur/J mice (obtained fromThe Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) to C57BL/6J females. Mice were genotyped by PCRof tail-tip DNA and housed under standard conditions with free access to food and water.For drug studies, SOD1-G93A transgenic animals from the same backcross generation wererandomly assigned to treatment groups at 55 days of age. Both males are females were used,and sexes and littermates were balanced across treatment groups. AK7 (20 mg/kg) or vehicle(5% Cremaphor in PBS) was administered daily via i.p. injection beginning at 60 days of age,before time of disease onset, which is 120 days of age. Mice were weighed and assessed twiceweekly for the first signs of disease onset using a standard neurological scoring system for ALSmice. Onset of symptoms was determined by the first appearance of neurological deficit, definedas the inability of the animal to fully splay its hindlimbs when briefly held suspended byits tail. Survival is defined as age at death or euthanasia due to end-stage disease. An animal atend-stage disease is euthanized when it cannot 1) right itself within 15 seconds of being placedon its side, 2) groom its face (detected by the development of infections in one or both eyes), or3) move around to reach food placed on the cage floor. Time of disease onset and survival werecompared among treatment groups using Kaplan-Meier curves and the Log-Rank test.",

The L4 to L5 regions were identified according to standardanatomical guidelines described in [67] using an Olympus BX61 upright light microscope with10x, 20x and 40x objectives. Briefly, the L4 and L5 sections were identified according to thearea of the gracile fasciculus and dorsal corticospinal tract relative to the spinal cord centralcanal. In L3 sections, the dorsal corticospinal tract is smaller than in L4 and L5. Motor neuronnumbers in L4 and L5 were determined using stereological principles based on the counting of every 10th section with a total of 11 to 16 sections counted [68]. Every tenth consecutive L4 andL5 spinal cord section was counted until the sacral dorsal commissural nucleus appeared concomitantwith a decrease in size of the gracile fasciculus and dorsal corticospinal tract, whichare markers for L6. Motor neurons were identified by a large, darkly stained cell body, a palenucleus with a continuous boundary and one or more darkly stained nucleoli [67].",

All behavioraltesting was conducted in an environment with minimal stimuli so as to minimize any possibleeffects caused by changes in external stimuli. Animals were weighed before every testsession. Mice were observed, and disease progression tracked and graded according to a neurologicalscore sheet [69] to ensure that any non-ALS related deaths were excluded from thestudy. In accordance with ethical requirements, hSOD1G93A mice that became too weak toreach the food hoppers were provided with wet chow on the floor of the cages. The endpoint ofthe study was defined as the mouse being unable to right itself within 15 seconds after beingplaced on its back. Upon reaching end-stage or 25 weeks of age, transgenic mice and theirrespective wild-type littermates were euthanized with pentobarbital (120 mg/kg, i.p., Provet).Tissues, including the gastrocnemius muscle, were collected for subsequent analysis. To measurethe time point when body weight loss started, we defined the day where a loss of morethan 10% in an individual mouse occurred relative to its mean body weight from week 12 to17. Also all subsequent three body weight measurements were   90% of the original meanweight.",

        "text": "RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, Quantitative Real Time PCR Assay. After euthanasia, the gastrocnemius muscle was quickly removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen.To extract RNA, muscle samples were pulverized in liquid nitrogen with a cold mortar and pestle,dissolved with TRI reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and extracted accordingto the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Contaminating DNA was removed by DNAse Itreatment and cDNA was synthesized using the Tetro cDNA synthesis kit (Bioline, London,UK) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.The expression of several metabolic genes was assayed (Table 1) by quantitative real timePCR.All primer pairs were evaluated for efficiency using a 4 fold serial dilution series of musclecDNA. The derived slope of each primer pair was used to calculate the efficiency by applyingthe formula, 4[(-1/slope)-1] 100. Reactions consisting of diluted cDNA, 5\u03bcl of SYBR Green mastermix and 8\u03bcMof forward and reverse primers were amplified after an initial hot start. The thermalprofile for the assay was an initial hot start of 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 1 minute and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds (ABI 7900HT Fast Real-TimePCR system, Applied Biosystems). Lastly the melt curve was generated by heating to 95\u00b0C for 2minutes, cooling to 60\u00b0C for 15 seconds and a final 2% heating ramp to 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds.Samples without reverse transcriptase treatment were included to ensure that samples werefree from DNA contamination. To select reference genes for normalization, expression of tenhousekeeping genes in the different experimental groups were analyzed using GeNorm function. TATA binding protein (Tbp),\u03b22-microglobulin (B2m) and Hydroxymethylbilanesynthase (Hmbs) were chosen because they were the least changed in the experimental groups.The fold expression (\u0394CT) of the gene of interest (goi) relative to the geometric mean of housekeepinggenes (Tbp, B2m and Hmbs) were calculated with a formula adapted from [71] takinginto consideration the individual efficiencies (E) of each primer pair.",

        "text": "Administration of 5-FU. To determine the effect of 5-FU on blood cell counts, ten SOD1G93A mice at age of 10 weekswere subjected to a single intraperitoneal injection of 5-FU at 150 mg/kg. The drug was freshly diluted in saline (15 mg/ml) and the volume of each individual injection was between 0.18 and0.32 ml. For the behavioural tests, survival assay and serial blood extractions to determine theevolution in the number of hematopoietic stem cells (see below), SOD1G93A mice wereinjected as with 5-FU or with saline every two weeks (age of 10, 12 and 14 weeks). This fortnightlydose corresponds to a low dose of 12.2 mg/kg, or 450 mg/m2, in humans [13]. The totalnumber of mice used for survival assay was 58 (29 treated with 5-FU and 29 with saline), ofwhich 22 were also used for behavioural assays (11 treated with 5-FU and 11 with saline). Serialblood sampling was conducted on 20 mice (10 treated with 5-FU and 10 with saline).",

Two sex balanced groups of SOD1G93A mice (n = 11 per group) were randomly distributedto evaluate the progression of the disease and locomotor function by rotarod and hang-wiretests. Starting at the age of ten weeks (before the first injection), these tests were performedweekly until the mice reached the endpoint criteria following the international guidelines for preclinical studies with ALS mice [14]. In the rotarod test, the time mice were able to maintaintheir balance on the wheel was recorded. For assessing muscle strength, the mice were placedon a wire lid, gently turned upside down and the latency to fall was timed. In both tests, animalswere given three opportunities to reach a maximum of 180 seconds and only the best performancewas considered.

At the age of 15 weeks (five days after the last injection), plasma and skeletal muscle from5-FU treated or vehicle treated SOD1G93A mice, as well as wild-type littermates (n = 8 for allgroups), were collected and processed for gene expression analysis. Left quadriceps femorismuscles were dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Each muscle was pulverizedin liquid nitrogen using a Cellcrusher cryogenic tissue pulverizer (Cellcrusher, Cork, Ireland)and half of the power was kept at -80\u02daC for protein extraction (below). The powered muscletissue was further homogenized using a PRO200 homogenizer (PRO Scientific Inc) and RNAwas extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Potential residual genomic DNA was eliminatedusing the Turbo DNA-free Kit (Ambion) and 1\u03bcg of DNAse-treated RNA was retrotranscriptedusing the Superscript First Strand kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR(qRT-PCR) was performed from 1:10 diluted cDNA in triplicates using StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The gene-specific TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems)used are indicated in Table 1.

Score 1: Collapse or partial collapse of leg extension towards lateral midline (weakness) ortrembling of hind legs during tail suspension. Score 2: Toes curl under at least twice during walking of 12inches, or any part of foot is dragging along cage bottom/table; when the mice are unable to run for longerthan 1 min at 15 rpm. Score 3: Rigid paralysis or minimal joint movement, foot not being used forgenerating forward motion. Score 3.5: paralysis in both hind legs. Score 4: Mouse cannot right itselfwithin 30 seconds after being placed on either side; or ascend to the forelimbs; or death.",

Each mouse was given upto three attempts to hold on to the inverted lid for amaximum of 90 seconds, and the longest period wasrecorded.The Rotarod apparatus (KN-75, Natsume Seisakusho,Japan) was used to assess motor performance,coordination, and balance.16 Rotarod performance wasassessed twice a week in SOD1-G93A mice starting from 70 postnatal days a day or two days after the hangingwire test. Mice were trained for 2\u20133 days to getacquainted with the rotarod apparatus. The testing beganby placing each mouse on the rod rotating at 12 rotationsper minute.

Mice weredeeply anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (10 ml/kgweight body, intraperitoneal injection, i.p.). Normal bodytemperature was maintained with a heating lamp. The sciatic nerve was stimulated at a paraspinal site.Stimulation consisted of single 0.2-ms, 1-Hzsupramaximal pulses through a needle electrode. Aground needle electrode was inserted into thesubcutaneous tissues on the back of the mouse. An anodeneedle was inserted at the base of the tail. A referenceneedle electrode was placed over the Achille\u2019s tendon.The evoked compound muscle action potential (CMAP)amplitude was recorded from the medial part of thegastrocnemius muscle with a unipolar needle electrode.An initial negative deflection and biphasic waveformindicated recording at the correct point. A modifiedstatistical method of motor unit number estimation(MUNE) was performed as previously described.17Briefly, once a CMAP was measured throughsupra-maximal stimulation, a stimulus-response curvewas obtained by delivering 30 computer-controlledstimuli with gradually increased intensity. Any peak withgreater than 10% of the total CMAP was investigated todetermine the response of a single large-amplitude motorunit. Four response ranges were chosen, which were:10%\u201320%, 25%\u201335%, 40%\u201350% and 55%\u201365% ofmaximal response.

The zebrafish were then pinned with fine (0.001 inch) tungsten wires through their notochords toa Sylgard-lined dish. The outer layer of skin between the pins was removedusing a fine glass electrode and forceps exposing the musculature.

Briefly, paired motor motoneuron/muscle recordings were obtained by perfusing collagenase (1 mg/ml) over thepreparation for 10 min. This allowed for partial digestion before red andwhite muscle cells overlying the spinal cord were removed by aspirationto expose the spinal cord while leaving the ventral root and deeper musclecells intact.

Mitochondrial respiration was measured polarographically using a Cole-Parmer (Vernon Hills, IL) oximeter fitted with a water-jacketed Clark-type electrode (model 5300; YSI, YellowSprings, OH) in an incubation chamber of 1.6 ml capacity as described previously (Cassina and Radi, 1996). Briefly, oxygen consumption studies were performed in homogenization buffer at 37\u00b0C, pH 7.4, at 0.2\u2013 0.5mg/ml mitochondria. Glutamate\u2013malate (2.5mM each) and succinate (5mM) were used to quantify complex I- and II-dependent respiration,respectively. Rotenone (2  M) and antimycin A (AA; 2  M) were used as complex I and III inhibitors, respectively. For each complex respiration,we also tested the addition of the ATPase inhibitor oligomycin (5  M)and the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). ADP was used to evaluate mitochondrial coupling. The respiratory control ratio (RCR) was calculatedas the ratio of oxygen consumption rates after (state 3) and before (state4) ADP addition. The purity of the mitochondrial fraction was confirmed by measuring cytochrome c oxidase and lactate dehydrogenase activities as markers of mitochondria and cytosol, respectively (Radi etal., 1991).",

The probe JC-1 was used to measure mitochondrial membrane potential (Almeida el al, 2001) and MitoSOX Red to measure mitochondrial superoxide (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2007). Cells weremildly trypsinized and resuspended at a density of 4   105 cells/ml inprewarmed (37\u00b0C) PBS solution supplemented with 20 mM glucose and 2% FBS, pH 7.4, containing JC1 (2  M) or MitoSOX Red (2.5  M). Aftera 15 min incubation period at 37\u00b0C in the dark, cell suspensions were centrifuged and resuspended in probe-free solution. Data acquisition was performed in a CyAn ADP cytometer (Dako, High Wycombe, UK).Astrocytes were gated to exclude subcellular debris as differentiated byforward and side scatter. Probes were excited with a 488 nm laser. JC-1monomer fluorescence signal was detected on FL1 (green fluorescence,centered around 530 nm), and JC-1 aggregates on the FL2 detector (redfluorescence, centered around 575 nm). Mean fluorescence intensity valuesfor FL1 and FL2 were obtained for all experiments. The relativeaggregate/monomer (red/green) fluorescence intensity values were usedfor data presentation. These values were expressed in a percentage scale,with the red/green fluorescence ratio values of nontransgenic astrocytes(3.7   0.30) considered as 100% and the red/green fluorescence ratiovalues of FCCP-treated transgenic astrocytes considered as 0%. MitoSOXRed fluorescence was detected in FL2 (red fluorescence, centeredaround 575 nm) and expressed as a percentage of nontransgenic cells.",

The sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides and kept at  80\u00b0C.Briefly, slides were dried for 45 min on a hot plate (70\u00b0C), rehydrated for 10 min in PBS, and fixed for 10 min with 4% PFA. For CBP and AcH3 immunostainings, endogenous peroxidases were inactivated by 10 min of incubation in 1% H2O2/PBS. Antigenic sites were then uncovered in acitrate buffer (1.8 mM citric acid and 8 mM sodium citrate), warmed for 10 min in a microwave oven, and cooled down on ice. Sections were permeabilized for 10 min in 1% Triton X-100/PBS before being blockedfor 30 min in 5% goat serum/0.1% Triton X-100/PBS. Primary antibodieswere applied overnight, and secondary antibodies were applied for1 h. Revelation was performed using the Vectastain ABC kit (VectorLaboratories, Burlingame, CA). For ChAT immunostaining, the method was adapted to a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Pictures weretaken with a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) digital camera DXM 1200. ChAT positivecells were counted in the ventral horn from six spinal cord sections per animal as described previously (Dupuis et al., 2004). For counting innervated synapses, 40- m-thick longitudinal sections of PFAfixed,sucrose-embedded, and frozen soleus muscles were cut and stainedwith antibodies against synaptophysin and  -BGT. The same protocol was used for p75 immunostaining. Usually 5\u20136 sections were analyzedper animal, which represents 100\u2013150 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(nAChR) clusters. Immunostaining was analyzed confocally (Laser ScanningSystem 510; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).",

RNA concentrations were quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer, then 200 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit. Primers for hCTR1 were GCTGGAAGAAGGCAGTGGTA and GGCCACGCCATAGAGTTTG, and for mCtr1 they were TTCTTCAGGGTAGCTTCCGAGTA and CAACCTAGCGCAGGGATCT. Each 10 \u03bcl reaction mix consisted of 300 nm primers, 5 \u03bcl 2\u00d7 Power SYBR Green Master Mix, and 20 ng of cDNA template. Duplicate reactions were performed using the LightCycler 480 (Roche) and the following conditions: 10 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C, and 60\u00b0C for 60 s. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated as the lowest cycle number producing an exponential increase in PCR product amplification. Samples with Ct values <30 were excluded from all analyses. The \u0394Ct method was used to normalize hCTR1 gene expression in each sample to the expression of endogenous mCtr1. To assess whether hCTR1 expression altered the expression of endogenous mCtr1, the \u0394Ct method was used to normalize mCtr1 gene expression in each sample to the expression of endogenous mActb.",

        "text": "Mass spectrometric quantification. The metal status and total SOD concentration was determined as described previously (Rhoads et al., 2011) with the following modifications. Mouse tissues were dissected and frozen on a plastic dissection plate placed on a block of dry ice to maintain a subzero temperature. For spinal cords, 1- to 2-mm-thick transverse sections were cut with a razor blade, laid flat on the dissection plate, and 0.3-mm-diameter punches of either dorsal or ventral gray matter (300 \u03bcm biopsy punch, Zivic Instruments) were obtained. The tissue was expelled with air from the punch onto a tarred aluminum weigh boat (VWR) and then weighed to the nearest microgram using an analytical balance (model 25 automatic electrobalance, Cahn). Punch weights ranged between 90 and 200 \u03bcg. The punch was then mixed with 5 \u03bcl of 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.1, containing 500 nm bovine SOD as an internal standard. The supernatant was then bound to an equilibrated C4 Ziptip (Millipore) and desalted by aspirating with 10 \u03bcl of deionized water, which was repeated six times. The point of the Ziptip was then pressed into PEEK tubing, leading to the electrospray ionization source of an LTQ-FT Ultra MS unit (Thermo Scientific) with an electrospray ionization interface in positive-ion mode. A second piece of PEEK tubing coming from the HPLC pump was inserted into the rear of the Ziptip, and the tip was then perfused with a mobile phase of 30% (v/v) acetonitrile/water with 100 \u03bcm formic acid (at 30 ml/min). The elution of SOD occurred over 2\u20133 min, after which time the total ion count returned to baseline. Integration and quantitation of SOD was performed as described previously (Rhoads et al., 2011, 2013).",

Laser ablation ICPMS (LA-ICPMS) imaging mass spectrometry was performed on paraformaldehyde-fixed spinal cord transverse sections, as previously described (Hare et al., 2012; Lear et al., 2012). Imaging mass spectrometry is a relatively new analytical science that combines discrete solid sampling with mass specific detection. LA-ICPMS uses high-energy laser pulses to provide a source of particles for inorganic mass spectrometry, allowing spatial profiling of trace metals directly in solid samples. Quantitative images depicting the spatial distribution of metals in tissue sections are produced by rastering the laser beam across the tissue surface.",

Two hundred cells were scored for dye color and nuclear morphology for each sample (duplicate wells/treatment). The cells were classified as necrotic (primary necrosis), apoptotic (apoptotic and secondary necrosis) or live. The percentage of each phenotype was calculated.",

        "text": "2.2. Tissue preparation for electron microscopy. To detect intracellular calcium under the electron microscope, tissue samples were processed using the oxalate-pyroantimonate technique, originally described by Borgers et al. [36,37], adapted, and routinely used in our laboratory [38\u201341]. The method provides fine ultrastructural preservations and results in electron-dense deposits (EDDs) due to the precipitation of tissue calcium by the fixative. Briefly, animals, under terminal anesthesia with intraperitoneally applied Equithesin (1% phenobarbital, 4% chloral hydrate, 6 ml/kg body weight), were transcardially perfused with 90 mM potassium oxalate (Sigma; pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH) followed by 3% glutaraldehyde (Polysciences; pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH) containing 90 mM potassium oxalate. The brains, spinal cords, hindlimb interosseus muscles, and external oculomotor muscles were removed and fixed in the same fixative overnight (4 \u00b0C). Specimens were then rinsed in 7.5% sucrose (Molar) containing 90 mM potassium oxalate (pH 7.4), postfixed with 2% potassium pyroantimonate (Merck) + 1% osmic acid (Sigma; pH adjusted to 7.4 with acetic acid (Molar)) for 2 h (4 \u00b0C). Next, specimens were rinsed in distilled water (pH adjusted to 10 with KOH) for 10 min, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol (Molar), processed through propylene oxide (Sigma), and embedded in Durcupan ACM (Fluka). Blocks were polymerized for 48 h at 56 \u00b0C. Semithin (0.3 \u03bcm) sections were cut from the blocks on an Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica), etched [42], stained [43], and evaluated under an Eclipse 80i light microscope (Nikon) to identify pools of motor neurons in the brain tissue and zones of innervation in the muscles. After trimming the blocks to the appropriate regions, systematic sets of ultrathin sections (60 nm) were cut, mounted on uncoated 300 mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and contrasted with uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences; 2% in 50% ethanol) and lead citrate (Electron Microscopy Sciences; 2% in distilled water). The distance between the sections was 15 \u03bcm and 50 \u03bcm in muscle samples and blocks containing brain tissue, respectively, to avoid sampling identical neuromuscular synapses or motor neurons during the collection of electron microscopic fields of view for analysis.\n\nMotor neurons innervating the extraocular muscles, which represent groups of motor neurons resistant to Ca-mediated injury, were analyzed by electron microscopy, as well, in the mSOD1 mice at ages of 12- and 19-weeks.",

Total RNA from the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of 90 day old SOD1G93A mice and their wild-type control littermates was extracted using TRI Reagent (Sigma) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA was shipped to the sequencing IGA of Udine (https://appliedgenomics.org/it/). The libraries for sequencing were prepared using NuGEN Ovation System V2 RNA\u2013Seq. For each biological sample two independent experiments were carried out for the isolation of RNA. Read quality control was asserted through FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), and quality/adapter trimming was carried out using Trim Galore (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/), which itself is a wrapper for cutadapt. Subsequently, reads were pseudo aligned to transcriptome GRCm38 (mm10) using Kallisto version 0.43.1. Count tables were generated in R using the package tximport together with DESeq2. Differential expression of genes was conducted using DESeq2 with default options. Genes were considered differentially expressed if the adjusted P-value was<0.05.

Mitochondria were isolated from the TA, gastrocnemius (GNM), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), soleus and spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice and their wild-type control littermates, at different stages of the disease. According to Salvatori et al., tissues were homogenized in 210 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM HEPES KOH (pH 7.5) through a Glass/Teflon Potter Elvehjem homogenizer (Salvatori et al., 2017, 2018). The total concentration of mitochondria was determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Cat# 5000006) and the obtained quantity was normalized to the weight of the starting material to determine \u03bcg of mitochondria per mg of tissue. Tissue mitochondrial content was also assayed by quantitative real-time PCR in which the quantity of mitochondrial DNA / genomic DNA was evaluated (see also below in \u201cDNA-RNA isolation and Real Time PCR\u201d). Isolated mitochondria were resuspended in a minimum volume of Respiration Buffer (250 mM Sucrose, 15 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 30 mM K2HPO4), loaded (4 \u03bcg for skeletal muscles and 12 \u03bcg for spinal cord) onto a Seahorse XFe96 microplate, and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 2000 x g. After centrifugation 180 \u03bcl of Respiration Buffer [containing substrates: pyruvate (5 mM), malate (2.5 mM), glutamate (5 mM)] were added to each well, and the microplate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 8 min to equilibrate the plate temperature. During plate incubation, the XFe96 cartridge was loaded with drugs to a final concentration of: ADP 1 mM, oligomycin 3 \u03bcM , FCCP 12 \u03bcM and Antimycin A 2 \u03bcM. Microplates containing mitochondria were then loaded into Seahorse XFe96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience-Agilent) and the assay was completed according to the protocol developed by Seahorse Agilent. Coupling assays were performed across 6 technical replicates per plate, for 3 experiments. This assay allows for the assessment of electron transport chain functionality and oxidative phosphorylation flow tracing O2 Consumption Rates (OCR) in basal conditions (mitochondrial State 2 respiration) and in response to the administration of ADP (maximal coupled respiration, or mitochondrial State 3 respiration), Oligomycin A (respiration due to proton leak, or mitochondrial State 4o respiration), FCCP (maximal uncoupled respiration, or mitochondrial State 3u respiration) and Antimycin A (inhibition of oxidative respiration).",

        "text": "Bioenergetic analysis of isolated skeletal muscle satellite cells. Skeletal muscle satellite cells were isolated from 55 day old SOD1G93A mice and agematched wild-type controls through magnetic beads-associated cells sorting according to Reggio et al. (Reggio et al., 2020). Mice were euthanized via cervical dislocation, and hindlimbs were carefully skinned, dissected and placed in HBSS supplemented with 2% BSA and 1% Pen/Strep (SupHBSS). Muscles were dissociated from bones in a sterile hood and minced into small pieces. Minced tissue was separated at 700 x g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and digested with 2 \u03bcg/\u03bcl collagenase A (Roche), 2.4 U/ml dispase II (Roche), and 10 \u03bcg/ml DNase I (Roche) in DPBS w/calcium and magnesium, for 1h under agitation in a water bath at 37\u00b0C. Digested tissue was separated at 700 x g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, resuspended in SupHBSS and sequentially filtered through 100 \u03bcm, 70 \u03bcm and 40 \u03bcm nylon cell strainers previously hydrated with SupHBSS. After each filtration step, the cell suspension was separated and resuspended. Red blood cells were lysed with RBC buffer (ChemCruz) between the 70 \u03bcm and 40 \u03bcm filtration steps by incubating the cell pellet in 1 ml of 1X RBC for 2.5 min on ice, and inactivated with SupHBSS. The final cell suspension was separated and resuspended in magnetic beads buffer (MBB) consisting of DPBS w/o calcium and magnesium supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA, and filtered through 30 \u03bcm cell strainer. Cell sorting was carried out by incubating the cell pellet with anti-CD45 and anti-CD31 antibody to eliminate immune/hematopoietic and endothelial cells. Incubation with anti-7-integrin antibody yielded the satellite cell fraction. To precipitate contaminating fibroblasts, the 7-integrin positive fraction was pre-plated for 2h in growth medium consisting of DMEM high-glucose Glutamax (Gibco), supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% pen/strep, 20% FBS, 10% horse serum, and 2% chicken embryo extract. Unattached cells were recovered and plated for proliferation in CytoGROW medium (Resnova) at a density of 200000 cells/100 mm dish. After 4 days of proliferation, cells were trypsinized and counted for analysis using a Seahorse XFe96 Extracellular Flux Analyser (Seahorse Bioscience-Agilent, USA). Bioenergetic profiles of skeletal muscle satellite cells isolated from SOD1G93A mice and wild-type age-matched controls were performed using a Mito Stress Test Kit (Seahorse Bioscience), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and according to Salvatori and collaborators (Salvatori et al., 2018).",

        "text": "Treatment and assessment of motor function. In order to evaluate the best effective dose of drug, 110 day old SOD1G93A transgenic mice and their wild-type control littermates (n=6 for each dose) were treated for seven days with or without Ranolazine (Selleckchem, catalog #S1425) (0 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg) by daily intraperitoneal injection. Motor ability were monitored as described in Ferraro et al., and in detail elaborated here, using the hanging grid test at days 0, 2, 5 and 7 of treatment; the average value from three trials (recorded from each mouse) was averaged to determine the final test score (Ferraro et al., 2016). Improvements in performance was expressed as a percentage of the starting value obtained at day 0, which was designated as 100%. After seven days of treatment, animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation and the TA and GNM muscles were rapidly excised for subsequent analyses. The selected dose of Ranolazine (50 mg/kg) was then administered to SOD1G93A transgenic mice at the onset of the disease (90 days old) and wild-type age-matched control mice. A control group of SOD1G93A transgenic and wild-type age-matched control mice were treated with physiological solution. Mice were weighed and assessed by the hanging grid test once per week starting at beginning of treatment. The final weekly motor functionscore per mouse per week was determined as above. Groups of 120 day (n=12) and 150 day old mice (n=11/12) were sacrificed for evaluation of mid- and longterm treatment effects respectively. Survival was determined by noting the day at which animals achieved full paralysis of hind limbs and were not able to right within 30 s after being turned on the back. At this stage animals were sacrificed according to guidelines for preclinical testing (Poppe et al., 2014). In order to minimize sex related differences, we used male mice for both pilot and long-term treatments.",

Following isolation by the Ficoll-Hypaque technique, approximately 4.0 x 106 PBMCs were incubated overnight in IMDM medium alone (baseline), IMDM with 2 \u03bcg/ml SOD1, or IMDM with tocilizumab (2 \u03bcg/ml) and SOD1. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in RNA preserve medium (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini-prep (+ deoxyribonuclease step) kit and, as needed, concentrated and cleaned up (Qiagen RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit) on the day the array was plated. cDNA was then prepared from 200 ng of total RNA using the RT2 First Strand Kit and was added to RT-PCR reagent SYBR Green Master Mix according to manufacturer protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Ten microliters of the mixture was added to each of the 384-wells of the RT2 Profiler inflammatory and autoimmune gene array PAHS- 077G (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The RT-PCR reaction was performed on the Roche LightCycler 480. Data was processed by the \u0394\u0394Ct method using proprietary tools supplied by SABiosciences PCR Data Analysis Web Portal (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Each custom array included control wells of (a) the threshold cycle values for genomic DNA contamination, (b) inhibition of reverse transcription, (c) a positive PCR control, and (d) three housekeeping genes. The fold regulation for a given gene was calculated by comparing a control to a treatment group and using the 2 (-\u0394\u0394Ct) normalized with housekeeping genes and other genes on the array with recorded Ct values within 0.5 cycles across the control and treatment groups.\n\nWe have investigated the degree of baseline (i.e. background) inflammation in PBMCs of sporadic ALS patients and controls by qRT- PCR analysis of transcription of ninety genes associated with inflammatory signaling.",

For the mast cell analysis based on metachromasia observation, as previously described (10), 10-\u03bcm sections of quadriceps human muscle (paraffin sections) and rat sciatic nerves, dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord (fixed frozen sections) were microtome or cryostat sliced and mounted in gelatin-coated slides, respectively. Human muscle slices were deparaffinized before starting staining. Sections were washed and hydrated 2 times in distilled water for 10 minutes and embedded in 1% toluidine blue solution for 10\u201320 minutes. Then, slides were washed in distilled water 3 times 5 minutes and dehydrated for 3 minutes in 70% ethanol, 3 minutes in 95% ethanol, and finally 2 minutes in 100% ethanol. Slides were cleared in xylene twice, 3 minutes each, and finally mounted in DPX (Sigma-Aldrich). Images (at \u00d710, \u00d720, and \u00d7100 magnification) were acquired using an Olympus CX41 microscope connected to a EvolutionLC Color camera and using ImagePro Express software for acquisition. For human mast cell counting, at least 35 fields per quadriceps muscle (5 control and 5 ALS patients) were analyzed using a magnification of \u00d720. The number of toluidine blue\u2013positive metachromatic mast cells in the SOD1G93A rat model was counted using ImageJ software, in at least 20 fields per sciatic nerve (1 cm long) per animal using a magnification of \u00d710. For dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord analysis, at least ten 8-\u03bcm sections from 3 different rats among groups were stained and analyzed for toluidine blue\u2013positive mast cells. Degranulating rat mast cells, characterized by extensive metachromatic granules being released by an isolated cell, were counted using \u00d720 magnification in at least 20 serial pictures of each sciatic nerve section (n = 4). \n\nHuman and rat data are expressed as the number of mast cells per mm2.For histological characterization of the muscle samples, toluidine blue staining was used to identify metachromatic mast cells",

The level of calcium in the perikaryonal region of the MNs was considered to be refl ected by the volume density of the EDDs and was determined by point-counting methods in electron microscopic prints.

An unbiased estimation of the number of MNs in the lumbar segment of the spinal cord was performed by using the physical disector, optimized for sampling such cells in our earlier experiments (14). Pairs of 300-nm-thick toluidine blue-stained sections, cut at a distance of 8 \u03bc m, were used for the study. Data were expressed as cell numbers in mm 3 of spinal cord tissue for each animal. The cell numbers and the relative volumes of the EDDs in the treatment groups were expressed as means SEM.

For the small molecule screen or for standard survival assays, freshly dissociated EBs were plated at a density of 8,000 GFP+ cells (384-well) or 30,000 GFP+ cells (96-well) per well. Four days later, trophic factors were removed, and individual compounds were added to the wells. For the primary screen each compound was tested at three concentrations (0.1\u03bcM, 1\u03bcM and 10\u03bcM) in duplicate. After an additional 72 hours (day 7), cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies) and scanned using an automated confocal microscope (PerkinElmer Opera) at 10\u00d7 magnification. The number of MNs surviving was analyzed by counting the remaining GFP+ cells in the whole well. Total cell numbers were obtained by counting Hoechst-positive nuclei. A size threshold was set based on control cultures to eliminate apoptotic MNs. Unless stated otherwise, survival is measured as fold-increase compared to cultures maintained without trophic factors. For long-term MN survival assays, MN cultures were fed with fresh medium and compounds every two days until fixation and quantification as above. For gene-specific knockdown with shRNAs, plated MNs were infected with lentivirus carrying shRNAs on day 2, trophic factors were withdrawn on day 4, and cells were fixed on day 7.",

A 241-bp digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probe was generated from 100 ng control genomic DNA (gDNA) by PCR reaction using Q5\u00ae High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) with primers shown in Supplementary Data Table 4. Genomic DNA was harvested from control and patient iPSCs using cell lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM EDTA, 1% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) at 55\u00baC overnight and performing phenol:chloroform extraction. A total of 25 \u03bcg of gDNA was digested with XbaI at 37 \u00baC overnight, run on a 0.8% agarose gel, then transferred to a positive charged nylon membrane (Roche) using suction by vacuum and UV-crosslinked at 120 mJ. The membrane was pre-hybridized in 25 ml DIG EasyHyb solution (Roche) for 3 h at 47 \u00baC then hybridized at 47 \u00baC overnight in a shaking incubator, followed by two 5-min washes each in 2X Standard Sodium Citrate (SSC) and in 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and two 15-min washes in 0.1x SSC and in 0.1% SDS at 68 \u00baC. Detection of the hybridized probe DNA was carried out as described in DIG System User\u2019s Guide. CDP-Star\u00ae Chemilumnescent Substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for detection and the signal was developed on X-ray film (Genesee Scientific) after 20 to 40 min.",

        "text": "Whole Cell Patch Clamp Electrophysiology. Whole cell membrane potential and current recordings in voltage- and current-clamp configurations were made using an EPC9 patch clamp amplifier controlled with PatchMaster software (HEKA Electronics). Voltage- and current-clamp data was acquired at 50 kHz and 20 kHz, respectively, with a 2.9 kHz low-pass Bessel filter, while spontaneous action potential recordings were acquired at 1 kHz sampling frequency. For experiments, culture media was exchanged with warm extracellular solution consisting of (in mM): 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, and 10 glucose, with pH adjusted to 7.3 and osmolarity adjusted to 305 mOsm. Glass patch pipettes were pulled on a Narishige PC-10 puller and polished to 5\u20137 M\u03a9 resistance. Pipettes were also coated with Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning) to reduce pipette capacitance. The pipette solution consisted of (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 2 KCl, 1CaCl2, 4 MgATP, 0.3 GTP, 8 phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 11 EGTA, adjusted to pH 7.25 and 290 mOsm. Pipettes were sealed to cells in G\u03a9-resistance whole cell configuration, with access resistances typically between 10\u201320 M\u03a9, and leakage currents less than 50 pA. Capacitance transients were compensated automatically through software control. For voltage clamp, cells were held at \u221270 mV. For Current-voltage traces, a P/4 algorithm was used to subtract leakage currents from the traces. Measurements were taken at room temperature (approximately 20\u201325 \u00b0C). Data was analyzed and plotted in Igor Pro 6 (WaveMetrics) using Patcher\u2019s Power Tools plug-in and custom programmed routines. Current density was obtained by dividing the measured ion channel current by the cell capacitance. For control iMNs, 10/10 tested fired action potentials. For C9-ALS iMNs, 9/10 tested fired action potentials.",

For the glutamate treatment condition, 10 \u03bcM glutamate was added to the culture medium on day 17 and removed after 12 hours. Cells were then maintained in N3 medium with neurotrophic factors without RepSox. For the glutamate treatment condition with glutamate receptor antagonists, cultures were co-treated with 10 \u03bcM MK801 and CNQX, and 2 \u03bcM Nimodipine during the 12 hour glutamate treatment. The antagonists were maintained for the remainder of the experiment. For the neurotrophic factor withdrawal condition, BDNF, GDNF, and CNTF were removed from the culture medium starting at day 17. Longitudinal tracking was performed by imaging neuronal cultures in a Nikon Biostation CT or Molecular Devices ImageExpress once every 24\u201372 hours starting at day 17. Tracking of neuronal survival was performed using SVcell 3.0 (DRVision Technologies). Neurons were scored as dead when their soma was no longer detectable by RFP fluorescence. All neuron survival assays were performed at least twice, with equal numbers of neurons from three individual replicates from one of the trials being used for the quantification shown. All trials quantified were representative of other trials of the same experiment. When iMNs from multiple independent donors are combined into one survival trace in the Kaplan-Meier plots for clarity, the number of iMNs tracked from each line can be found in Supplementary Table 5.",

CC-3186) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. To force expression of dipeptide repeat proteins in the astrocytes, lentiviruses were produced in HEK 293T cells and concentrated ~80-fold using Lenti-X Concentrator (Clontech). When astrocytes reached 90% confluency, they were transduced with lentiviruses encoding either GFP or GR(50)-GFP. Fluorescence microscopy analysis was used to confirm that 60\u201380% of astrocytes were transduced in both conditions. To measure glutamate uptake, GFP- or GR(50)-GFP-expressing astrocytes were incubated with 200 mM glutamate in Astrocyte Growth Medium for 2 hours at 37 degrees Celsius in biological quadruplicate. Media samples were collected after 2 hours and glutamate levels were quantified using the BioVision Glutamate Colorimetric Assay Kit (cat. no. K629) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

        "text": "MEA Recording. After 24 days of differentiation, equal numbers of control and ALS neurons were plated on poly-D-lysine/laminin coated p515A probes (Alpha Med Scientific) or M768-GLx 12-well plates (Axion BioSystems) at typical densities of 40,000\u201380,000/probe or well. All probes were visualized immediately before each recording session to confirm a full monolayer of cells. Initial experiments (11a, 18a, 39b, and RB9d comparison) were performed as close as possible to the time of patch recordings (4 weeks). However, because we wished to evaluate firing at a time point prior to significant motor neuron death (Kiskinis et al., 2014), we performed subsequent experiments (39b-Cor and 39b comparison and all later experiments) at day 14 after dissociation (Table S1). Recordings from 64 extracellular electrodes were made using a Med64 (Alpha Med Scientific) or Maestro (Axion BioSystems) MEA recording amplifier with a head stage that maintained a temperature of 37\u00b0C. For Med64 recordings, data were sampled at 20 kHz, digitized, and analyzed by spike clustering and spike extraction algorithms using Mobius software (Alpha Med Scientific) with a 2 kHz 9-pole Bessel low pass filter, 10 \u03bcV action threshold detection limit, and 30% cluster similarity radius. These standard settings were maintained for all analyses. We confirmed that we obtained similar results across a wide range of action potential threshold and cluster similarity radius settings. Correlation analysis to detect and correct for clusters detected by multiple electrodes was performed using custom Matlab software. Total action potential firing rates and mean neuronal firing frequencies were then determined and plotted. In order to record in larger replicates, we used the Axion Maestro MEA device, in a 12-well format with 64 extracellular electrodes in each well. For Maestro recordings, data were sampled at 15 kHz, digitized, and analyzed using Axion Integrated Studio software (Axion BioSystems) with a 200 Hz high pass and 2500 kHz low pass filter and an adaptive spike detection threshold set at 5.5 times the standard deviation for each electrode with 1 second binning. These standard settings were maintained for all Axion MEA recording and analysis. For retigabine dose response curves, action potential numbers during one minute of recording in each concentration of retigabine were normalized to the initial action potential number during one minute of recording in standard extracellular saline solution. \n\nThe EC50 value was determined by fitting the mean normalized data values to the Hill equation, y = 1/ ((EC50/x)nH+1) where nH is the Hill coefficient.",

        "text": "Patch Electrophysiology. Whole-cell patch recordings were performed on iPS-derived motor neurons identified by transduction with an Hb9::RFP lentivirus. Lentiviral transduction was typically performed 7\u201310 days before recording. Two large comparisons were performed, one consisting of 11a, 18a, 39b, and RB9d, and the second consisting of 39b-Cor and 39b. Each comparison was made from pooled data from multiple separate experiments, each consisting of synchronous and parallel iPSC culture and differentiation, embryoid body dissociation, plating and maturation of control- and ALS-derived neurons. Equal numbers of control and ALS motor neurons were recorded from each experiment. Comparison of the original four lines (11a, 18a, 39b, and RB9d) was made using four separate parallel differentiation experiments, while comparison of the isogenic correction comparison (39b-Cor and 39b) was performed using three separate parallel differentiation experiments. For each experiment, neurons from control and ALS lines were dissociated after 24 days of differentiation and plated onto poly-d-lysine/laminin coated glass coverslips (20,000\u2013 40,000/coverslip) and allowed to mature for four weeks from start of differentiation. We chose four weeks as the best timepoint because this yielded the most homogeneous population of mature-appearing Hb9::RFP-positive motor neurons (at the requisite low cell density for patch clamp) with the most mature electrophysiological properties. Whole-cell current-clamp and voltage-clamp recordings were performed using a Multiclamp 700B (Molecular Devices) at room temperature (21\u201323\u00b0C). Data were sampled at 20 kHz and digitized with a Digidata 1440A A/D interface and recorded using pCLAMP 10 software (Molecular Devices). Data were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries on a Sutter Instruments P-97 puller and had resistances of 2\u20134 M\u03a9. The pipette capacitance was reduced by wrapping the shank with Parafilm and compensated for using the amplifier circuitry. Series resistance was typically 5\u201310 M\u03a9, always less than 15 M\u03a9, and compensated by at least 80%. Neurons were excluded from analysis if holding current at \u221280 mV exceeded 100 pA, input resistance was less than 250 or greater than 2000 M\u03a9, or spikes elicited from \u221265 mV had peaks below 0 mV. Resting membrane potential was determined by averaging for 20s of recording, and afterwards a small holding current (typically with amplitude less than 5 pA) was used to clamp the resting membrane potential as close as possible to \u221265 mV. Rheobase was measured by applying 1 s steps in increments of 2.5 pA until an action potential was generated. Current ramps were elicited from an initial hyperpolarizing current of 10 pA for 1 s followed by a 210 pA/s depolarizing ramp of duration 1 s. Spikes on the ramps were counted if the peak voltage exceeded \u221210 mV. Action potential properties (Table S2) were determined using custom-written analysis software in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics) with DataAccess (Bruxton) for importing the files. For voltage-clamp recordings, voltages were elicited by 100-ms depolarizing steps from a holding potential of \u221280 mV to test potentials ranging from \u221280 mV to 50 mV in 10 mV increments. For the latter gene correction experiments the step length was increased to 200 ms to assay delayed-rectifier currents after more complete decay of transient potassium currents. For retigabine patch applications, resting membrane potential was recorded immediately before and 10 seconds after the application of 10 \u03bcM retigabine (in each case, membrane potential was an average of values sampled for 20 seconds). For all patch experiments, series resistance was monitored by brief \u22125 pA hyperpolarizing steps during current clamp recordings and by 5 mV hyperpolarizing steps during voltage clamp recordings. Electrode drift was measured at the end of each recording and was typically 1\u20132 mV. The extracellular solution was sodium-based and contained 135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES 10, pH 7.4. The intracellular solution was potassium-based and contained 150 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM NaGTP, 10 mM Na2PhosCr, 1mM EGTA, pH 7.4. For isolation of delayed-rectifier potassium channels (Figure 2G), 300 nM TTX and 100 \u03bcM CdCl2 were used to block voltage-gated sodium channels and voltage- and calciumactivated potassium channels, respectively. For isolation of voltage-gated sodium currents (Figure 2H), internal KCl was replaced by CsCl to block potassium currents and 100 \u03bcM CdCl2 was used to block calcium currents.To examine the electrophysiological properties of identified individual motor neurons, we transduced developing neurons with an Hb9::RFP lentiviral reporter and recorded only from RFP-positive motor neurons (Marchetto et al., 2008) using whole-cell patch clamp",

For survival analysis, slides were fixed at 3 and 30 days, and cultures were stained for counting. The number of ISL-positive, TUJ1-positive motor neurons (counter blinded to cell line identity) was normalized to the number on day 3 for each line. Retigabine (1 \u03bcM) or vehicle control was added from day 15 onwards. 11 total experiments (control motor neurons) and nine total experiments (ALS motor neurons) were performed from the same four separate differentiations. ER stress experiments were performed as described in Kiskinis et al. In brief, in two separate independent biological replicates, 300 ng of RNA was used to generate cDNA, of which 2 \u03bcL and AmpliTaq Gold Polymerase (Applied Biosystems) were used for PCR amplification. The amounts of spliced and unspliced bands were quantified using Image J. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in triplicate using the iSCRIPT kit (Biorad) for cDNA synthesis and SYBR green (Bio-Rad) labeling followed by amplification using the iCycler system (Bio-Rad).",

Motor function was evaluated in human SOD1 G93A transgenic mice by a paw grip endurance (PaGE) test and rotarod test between day 133 and day 147, at which point transgenic mice display severe motor dysfunction. The PaGE test was conducted according to the procedure described by Weydt et al. (2003). Briefly, the mice were placed on the wired lid of the cage until they firmly grabbed the wire. Then, gently, the lid was flipped upside down and the time until the mouse let go with at least both hind limbs was recorded. Twenty seconds were chosen as the arbitrary cutoff time. For the rotarod test, mice were placed on a rod (3 cm in diameter) and evaluated for their motor performance by rotating the rod at the speed of 7 rpm. One hundred twenty seconds were chosen as the arbitrary cutoff time. In both tests, each mouse was given at least three trials and the best record was chosen.",

        "text": "Immunoblotting. The primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal IgG against active form of STAT3 phosphorylated at amino acid residueY705 (p-STAT3) (Cat. No. 9131; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; diluted 1:2000), rabbit polyclonal IgG against STAT3 (Cat. No. 9132; Cell Signaling; diluted 1:2000), and mouse monoclonal IgG1 against b-actin (Clone No.AC-15; Sigma Chemical, St. Lous, MO, USA; diluted 1:10 000). The data sheets confirmed the specificity of the anti-STAT3 antibody with both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of STAT3. Freshly frozen materials of each spinal cord were used for obtaining nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts, using the NE-PERTM kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) containing the protease inhibitor cocktail Complete Mini\u00ae (Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany). Protein concentration in tissue samples was measured by the Bradford method.14 Samples were boiled for 10 min at 100\u00b0C with equal volumes of Laemli\u2019s buffer in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5 (TBS). Aliquots of the samples (20 mg/Lane) were separated by 10% sodium-dodecyl sulfate (SDS)- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto a polyvinyliden difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Tokyo, Japan). The PVDF membranes were treated for 1 h at room temperature with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) inTBS containing 0.1%Tween-20 (TBS-T) and subsequently incubated with the anti-p-STAT3 antibody in Can Get Signal\u00ae (Toyobo,Tokyo, Japan) overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK; diluted 1:10 000) in Can Get Signal for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreaction was visualized by the chemi-illuminescence method using the ECL-plus kit (GE). After eluting with stripping solution consisting of TBS and 1% mercaptoethanol, blots were treated for 1 h at room temperature with 5% skim milk in TBS-T and incubated with the anti-STAT3 antibody in 5% skim milk in TBS-T overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by the HRP-labeled antirabbit IgG in 5% skim milk in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then incubated with the anti-bactin antibody in 5% skim milk in TBS-T followed by HRP-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark; diluted 1:2000) in 5% skim milk in TBS-T to detect immunoreaction with the ECL kit (GE). Blots from which the primary antibodies were omitted served as negative reaction controls. Immunoreactive signals for p-STAT3, STAT3 and b-actin on blots were scanned using the Light-Capture Cooled Camera System\u00ae (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) and imported into a personal computer. Opitical densities of these signals were measured using the CS Analyzer\u00ae image software (ATTO).",

Multiple 6-mm-thick sections cut from OCT compound-embedded, frozen materials of each spinal cord were air-dried, rehydrated, quenched for 10 min at 4\u00b0C in 3% H2O2, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6 (PBS), pretreated for 20 min at room temperature with 3% skim milk in PBS, and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antbodies. Immunoreaction was visualized by the polymer immunocomplex (PIC) method using the Envision system (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) or the avidinbiotin- immunoperoxidase complex (ABC) method (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The chromogen was 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) or nickel dichloride/DAB mixture (NiCl2/DAB). Immunohistochemical localization of p-STAT3 and STAT3 was identified by the double-staining method with a light microscope.15 In brief, sections were incubated with the antibodies to the cell markers, and immunoreaction was detected by the PIC or ABC method using DAB as the chromogen. After microwaving (500 W, 95\u00b0C, 15 min) in citrate buffer, pH 6.0, sections were incubated with the antibodies to p-STAT3 and STAT3, and immunoreaction was detected by the PIC method using NiCl2/DAB as the choromogen.",

        "text": "2.2. HR-MAS 1H-MRS analysis. Neurochemical profiles were determined in 2 groups (saline or MSO-treated, N=6 per group, equal gender) of SOD1G93A mice. MSO or saline (20 mg/kg IP) was administered thrice weekly for 3 weeks (on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday); treatment was initiated at postnatal day 50 (\u00b12 days) and animals sacrificed at postnatal day 70 (\u00b12 days). The present study focused on glutamine (GLN), glutamate (GLU), \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA) and glutathione (GSH) levels in the dorsal anterior striatum (AST) and motor cortices. The motor cortex (MC) punch included primary somatosensory cortex, primary motor cortex, and secondary motor cortex (Fig. 1). Limitations of HR-MAS 1H-MRS include a dependence of proton visibility under MR conditions and sufficient concentrations (N0.5 mM); additionally, 1H-MRS measures do not differentiate extracellular or sub-cellular compartmentalization. After animals were sacrificed by decapitation, whole brains were immediately removed, placed in a chilled brain matrix (ASI, Warren, MI), and cut in 2 mmcoronal slices. Slices were immediately frozen on a solid CO2 then two contralateral, 1.5 mm (diameter) punches taken from the individual slices that contained the regions of interest [27]. Frozen punches were transferred to micro-centrifuge tubes and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until HR-MAS 1H MRS or HPLC analysis. Frozen intact tissue samples were weighed (\u223c3 mg) and placed directly into a Bruker zirconium rotor (4mm diameter, 10 \u03bcL capacity) containing 5\u03bcL buffer (pH=7.4; 100 mM potassium phosphate, 200 mM formate, 1 g/L NaN3 and 3 mM trimethylsilyl-propionate [TSP Sigma; St Louis, MO] diluted with an equal volume of D2O containing 0.75% TSP). TSP serves as an internal chemical shift reference (0.00 ppm), formate (8.44 ppm) for phase corrections, and D2O to lock on the center frequency. The rotor (with sample)was placed into a Brukermagic angle spinning probemaintained at 4 \u00b0C in a verticalwidebore (8.9 cm) Bruker 11.7 T magnet with an AVANCETM DRX-500 spectrometer (Bruker Biospin Corp., Billerica, MA). Rotors were spun at 4.2\u00b10.002 kHz at 54.7\u00b0 relative to the static magnetic field B0. Field inhomogeneities were compensated using first and second order manual and semi-automated shimming. After a pre-saturation pulse for water suppression, tissue spectra were acquired with a rotor-synchronized 1-D Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) [28] pulse sequence [90\u2013(\u03c4\u2013180\u2013\u03c4)n\u2013acquisition]. The inter-pulse delay (\u03c4) was 150 \u03bcs and the 180\u00b0 echo pulse was applied 12 times (n=12) for a total echo time TE=3.6 ms. The 90\u00b0 pulse length was 6 \u03bcs, acquisition time=1.169 s, 16384 complex data points, TR=6.21 s, and a spectral band width of 7 kHz (14 ppm) was used. The number of transients (number of samplings) was 32 with total acquisition time of 3 min 48 s. Signals were acquired with Bruker-XWINNMR (v 3.6 software) and the identical brain region from all animals (n=12: 6 treated with saline, 6 treated with MSO) randomly analyzed in a single session by an operator blind to drug treatment. Spectra were analyzed with a custom LCModel software package version 6.1\u20134 [29], utilizing a linear combination of 27 individual neurochemical model spectra (basis set) as well as non-specific lipid signals to fit the tissue spectrum and calculate absolute concentration values for neurochemicals with signals between 1.0 and 4.2 ppm. The precision of the LCModel fit to the spectral data was estimated with Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bounds which were acceptable under 25% and typically less than 10% for most of the metabolites reported herein. To account for variations in the mass of individual samples, absolute concentrations of MRvisible metabolites were corrected for tissue weight and are expressed as nmol/mg of wet tissue weight; variance associated with means (see Results) suggests a substantial degree of analytical reproducibility. Representative spectra from SOD1G93A striata (\u00b1MSO pretreatment) are presented in Fig. 2. \n\nLevels of glutamine (GLN), glutamate (GLU), \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutathione (GSH) in the motor cortex (MC) and dorsal anterior striatum (AST) were determined by HR-MAS 1H-MRS. \u204ePb0.05 compared to saline-treated controls.",

Neuromuscular function was then assessed bi-weekly thereafter; the day following the injections and every third day post-injection for six weeks, using four methods. The ALS motor score (7) and the BBB locomotor rating scale (33) were used to record the degree of ALS related motor disability and assess walking ability. An accelerating rotarod apparatus and an automated Grip Strength Meter (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) were used to assess motor performance and hindlimb grip strength, respectively. The average of three test trials was computed for both behavioral assays. The accelerating rotarod test was performed beginning at 5 rpm and increasing by 0.1 rpm/s until the rat fell off. All observations were performed by an investigator blinded to the treatment protocol. Rats were also observed daily and weighed bi-weekly. Disease onset was defi ned by the fi rst day an ALS motor score of 4 was recorded. The changes in rotarod performance and grip strength were expressed as a percentage change from baseline.",

One week after the last intramuscular injection (at 115 days of age), the rats were euthanized with an intraperitoneal overdose of pentobarbital, followed by transcardial perfusion with 0.9% saline and 4% paraformaldehyde solutions. The spinal cords were removed, cryoprotected overnight in 30% sucrose solution, and frozen in Optimal Cutting Temperature Compound (OCT). The potential neuroprotective effect of VEGF on motor neuron survival was assessed using published protocols (34,35). Briefl y, coronal spinal cord sections (30 \u03bc m) in the lumbar region were cut on a crytostat and stained with Cresyl violet. Images were obtained using a Nikon DS-Fil color digital camera on a Nikon E400 microscope and quantifi ed using the NIS-Elements software (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY). Motor neurons in these areas (minimum 180- \u03bc m interval; 14 \u2013 18 sections/rat) were scored based on size, morphology, and neuronal vacuolization by an investigator blinded to the treatment group. Cells with a readily identifi able nucleus were manually outlined to determine the area. Mean area of MNs was used as an assay for the relative size of these cells, which are recognized to atrophy in the course of disease. All neurons with an area 300 \u03bc m 2 were counted as motor neurons (36).",

        "text": "Western Blotting. For classical estrogen receptors (ERa and ERb), immunodetection western blotting was performed in control (non-treated) rat spinal cord explants. For Akt immunodetection rat, spinal cord explants were pre-incubated for 4 h in the absence of serum and then exposed to 17bE2 (10 nM) at selected times from 30 min to 48 h. The ER antagonist ICI 182,780 (1 lM) was added, when indicated, 2 h before 17bE2 exposure. After treatments, explants were rinsed rapidly in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 125 mM Tris buffer, pH 6.8 containing the broad-spectrum phosphatase inhibitor a-naphthyl acid phosphate (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini; Roche Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland). Lysates were sonicated and proteins quantified by means of the DC Protein Assay from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA, USA). Protein equivalents from each sample were resolved in SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to 0.45-lm nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) using a Bio-Rad semidry Trans-Blot, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Membranes were blocked at 21 \u00b1 1 C for 1 h with TBS containing 5 % non-fat dry milk, 0.5 % bovine serum albumin and 0.2 % Tween 20. Membranes were probed overnight at 4 C with the adequate primary antibodies: anti-ERa (1:500), anti-ERb (1:1,000) (both also employed for immunofluorescence, see below) and antiphospho- Akt (P-Akt) (Ser473) (1:1000; Cat. #9271) or anti-Akt (1:1000; Cat. #9272) from Cell Signaling Technology. Membranes were then washed with Tris buffer saline (TBS) for 10 min at 21 \u00b1 1 C (three times) and incubated for 2 h with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were finally developed with the chemiluminiscent peroxidase substrate and visualized in chemiluminiscence film (Amersham). The apparent molecular weight of proteins was determined by calibrating the blots with pre-stained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad).\n\nThe expression of classical estrogen receptors (ERa and ERb) in rat spinal cord embryonic explants was first studied by western blotting in order to test the specificity of the two commercial antisera.Extracts (10 lg of protein) were prepared and analyzed by western blotting using anti-phosphospecific Akt (P-Akt) antibody or anti-Akt as a control of the total amount of the specific protein loaded per lane",

For lectin cytochemistry, the lectin from Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato lectin) labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (25 lg/ml) was used. For P-Akt and P-GSK-3b, immunofluorescence cultures were pre-incubated for 4 h in the absence of serum and then for 2 (P-Akt) or 4 h (P-GSK-3b) in the presence of 17bE2 (10 nM). For Bcl-2 immunofluorescence cultures were treated for 72 h in the presence of 17bE2 (10 nM). The ER antagonist ICI 182,780 (1 lM) was added, when indicated, 2 h before 17bE2 exposure. After treatments, rat spinal cord explants were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 for 20 min at 21 \u00b1 1 C. Explants were washed three times with TBS, pH 7.6 and then blocked in 0.1 % Triton X-100, 5 % normal horse serum in TBS for 1 h. Explants were then incubated overnight at 4 C with one or two of the above primary antibodies. Immunofluorescence controls, performed by omitting the primary antibody, resulted in the abolition of the immunostaining. Sections were then incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibody: Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:200), Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cultures were then washed and mounted using fluorescent mounting media (DAKO). Images were obtained with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Images for the different experimental treatments were taken with similar conditions (laser intensities and photomultiplier voltages). The immunofluorescence of all the migrated motoneurons encountered in a well was quantified, with at least three wells for experimental condition. Quantitative analysis of the fluorescently labeled structures was performed in a blinded manner with ImageJ (W. Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). \n\nTo assess if the phosphorylation of Akt could also be detected specifically inImmunofluorescence after stimulation with 17bE2 (2h), immunofluorescence co-localization experiments were performed and showed the presence of phosphorylated Akt in these cells",

        "text": "Quantification of Apoptotic Motoneuron Death. Where indicated, rat spinal cord explants were exposed for 48 h to a combination of the cytokines TNF-a (10 ng/ml) and IFN-c (10 ng/ml). Explants receiving cytokines and 17bE2 (10 nM) were treated with estrogen 24 h prior to cytokines exposure. The ER antagonist ICI 182,780 (1 lM) was added, when indicated 2 h before 17bE2 exposure. Lysates from these explants were also processed for P-Akt and Akt immunodetection as previously described. The time of exposure and the concentration of the cytokines TNF-a and IFN-c were chosen based on our previous work demonstrating apoptotic motoneuron death under these conditions (Mir et al. 2009). The concentrations of 17bE2 and ICI 182,780 were chosen based on previous studies showing neuroprotective effects of 17bE2 (Honda et al. 2000). To assess whether the above treatments affected the viability of motoneurons, their ability to induce apoptotic cell death was monitored by means of the APOAC Annexin V-Cy3 apoptosis detection kit (Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described (Mir et al. 2009); this kit detects the presence of phosphatidylserine residues on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by means of the protein annexin conjugated to the fluorochrome Cy3.18 (Koopman et al. 1994). Briefly, explants were rinsed with PBS, pH 7.4 at 37 C for 10 min, and then exposed to annexin V-Cy3 (1 lg/ ml) in the binding buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Then, explants were rinsed again with PBS and processed for SMI-32 immunofluorescence. The percentage of motoneurons undergoing apoptotic cell death was assessed by counting the number of annexin V-Cy3 positive cells that could be identified as motoneurons both by morphological and immunocytochemical criteria (i.e., doublelabeled with annexin V-Cy3 and SMI-32), relative to the total number of motoneurons (SMI-32 positive) in the whole area of the well. Only motoneurons with their somata out of the explant were counted. Cell counts were done blindly as to the treatment condition and at least three different wells were counted for each experimental condition.",

The survival time was considered as the actual age of death or the time when mice were sacrificed because they had lost the ability to right themselves within 30 sec after having been placed on their sides according to established guidelines for drug testing in ALS mouse models (Ludolph et al., 2010). In order to proceed to euthanasia (primary end-point), the 30 sec/side righting test was performed by a researcher who was blinded to the treatment group.

        "text": "Western Blot Analysis. At the time of sacrifice, the spinal column containing the vertebrae and the spinal cord was immediately removed. The whole spinal cords were extracted from the spinal canal using a 20-ml syringe, filled with saline phosphate buffer and connected to a 21-gauge 1.5-inch-long needle; the needle was inserted into the caudal opening of the spinal canal, and, by applying pressure with the syringe piston, the spinal cord was flushed out of the rostral opening into a Petri dish containing phosphate buffer. The spinal cord was immediately stored at 2808C. For Western blot analysis, we used the whole spinal cord, because in end-stage animals the neuropathological changes affect the entire spinal cord (Yang et al., 2011). Tissues were processed as described by Danbolt et al. (1990) to generate a membrane-enriched pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 1 mM EDTA and stored at 2808C. The supernatant, containing cytosolic proteins, was stored at 2808C. Proteins were separated on 8% acrylamide gels and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST buffer (0.1 M Tris base, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) and then incubated with anti-A2A (1:1,00; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-GLT1 (1:8,000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-GFAP (1:5,000; Chemicon) and anti-b-tubulin (1:20,000; Chemicon) antibodies. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked antibody (1:5,000), visualization of the bound antibodies was performed with the ECL system (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Densitometric analyses were perfomed in ImageJ 1.64. \n\nThe expression of adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs), glial glutamate transporter (GLT1), and glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) were evaluated by Western blotting. The results showed that caffeine intake significantly shortened the survival of SOD1G93A mice (log rank test, P 5 0.01) and induced a nonsignificant advancing of disease onset.",

        "text": "2.2. Motor neuron cell count and western blotting for lumbar spinal cords. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) which is a well-known marker for cholinergic motor neurons staining was used to count motor neuron cells. Animals were sacrificed at different time-points (90 days and 110 days) depending on the clinical features of the G93A transgenic mice of ALS. Mice from each group were terminally euthanized with pentobarbital sodium and then perfused transcardially with cold PBS followed by cold paraformaldehyde. Lumbar spinal cords were dissected, fixed in paraformaldehyde, and cryoprotected in a cold sucrose solution. Dissection was performed carefully preserving the anatomical integrity of the spinal cord tissue and 12-\u03bcm-thick transverse sections were obtained. Motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord were stained for choline acetyltransferase (anti-ChAT; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and were counted, as previously described [9,22]. Motor neuron cells stained in the anterior horn of the lumbar spinal cord were counted. To evaluate the possible mechanisms of JGK-263 in the transgenic ALS mice model, western blotting of PI3K p85 and phospho-Akt, phospho-GSK-3\u03b2, and antibodies of apoptosis signals was performed. Forwestern blotting, micewere anesthetizedwith pentobarbital sodium, and intracardiac perfusion of PBS was carried out. Shortly after, the spinal cord of each mouse was quickly removed, cooled in ice-cold artificial cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) for 5 min, and stored at\u221280 \u00b0C. Each spinal cord was homogenized with a 1.0 ml homogenizer and type B pestle in a 10:1 volume/weight buffer containing 10mMTris (pH 7.4), 10mMEGTA, 250mMsucrose, 2 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin, 5 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin, 2 \u03bcg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Tissue lysates were centrifuged at 17,000 \u00d7g for 10 min, and supernatants were used to measure phospho-GSK-3\u03b2 (Cell Signaling Tech, Beverly, MA, USA), Caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Tech, Beverly, MA, USA), cytochrome C (Cell Signaling Tech, Beverly, MA, USA), PARP-1(Santa Cruz Biotech, Delaware, CA, USA), PI3K p85 (Santa Cruz Biotech, Delaware, CA, USA), and phosphor-Akt (Santa Cruz Biotech, Delaware, CA, USA) levels. Protein loading was controlled by probing for b-actin (Cell signaling, Beverly,MA, USA) antibody on the same membrane.\n\nWestern blot analysis showed decreased levels of cytochrome C (cytosol form), cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP-1 in the spinal cords of 110-day-old G93A transgenic ALS mice treated with JGK-263 compared to control mice",

Throughout the study, the movement behavior of the rats in both experiments was measured twice a week by using an Ugo Basile 7650 accelerating rotarod (20 rpm) that automatically recorded the time that the rats could stay on the rotarod (Linton Instruments, UK). Rotarod pretraining for 10 days was performed before the implantation in order to obtain a baseline for rotarod performance. At the end of the training period all rats remained at least 180 s on the rotarod. Starting from the second day after the implantation or the osmotic pump replacement, the motor performance of the rats was measured in a blinded manner. The time that each rat remained on the rotarod was recorded (latency to fall). The maximum latency was arbitrarily set to 180 s. Each test was repeated 3 times, and the longest time spent on the rotarod data/ results was used for the statistical analysis. For the experiments described in figure 4b, the group of 6 na\u00efve rats served as a standard. This group was also pretrained for 10 days and tested twice each week for a period of about 2 months.",

Each spinal cord and the associated nerve roots were dissected en bloc, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and processed for paraffin embedding. Twenty serial sections at the levels L1\u2013L5 (6 \u03bcm thick) from each spinal cord were stained with Nissl and the modified Bielschowsky methods [32] and examined using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with an attached Nikon DMX 1200 digital camera. ImagePro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, Md., USA) was used for quantitative analysis. Five sections in each series were used for histological analysis after each staining. Motor neurons were defined as cells present within the gray matter, ventral to the central canal and having a cell body >25 \u03bcm in diameter. All sections were collected at the same level across animals. The number of neurons per 100 mm 2 was calculated in 10 microscopic fields of each sample (objective magnification 40\u00d7). A total of 70\u2013100 motor neurons were measured for each spinal cord specimen. Only motor neurons having a distinct nucleus were counted, and their area was measured using ImagePro Plus software.

The time spent walking on the rotarod test was measured, and time was averaged over 3 days. If the mean time was less than 10 s, it was defined to be a rotarod failure. Symptom onset was defined to be the mouse\u2019s limbs shaking when suspended in the air by its tail, which has been suggested to be due to the clinical involvement of the upper motor neurons [29]. Disease end point was defined as the time when a mouse was unable to stand upright within 30 s after being placed on its side on a flat surface. At this point, the mice were euthanized [30, 31].",

Each animal was videotaped for 15 s. A scale of 0 to 3 based on severity was used to rate hindlimb clasping behavior: 0 = hindlimbs abducted away from the abdomen; 1 = one hindlimb adducted for at least 50% of the observation period; 2 = both hindlimbs partially adducted for at least 50% of the observation period; and 3 = both hindlimbs completely adducted for at least 50% of the observation period. Rate of 0.5, 1.5 or 2.5 was used when the performance of the mouse fell between two levels. Rates from three separate trials over three consecutive days was used to abstain an average.\n\nRotarod test, hanging wire test and hindlimb clasping test were used to determined disease onset and assess motor performance.",

In the meantime, Nissl detection kit (DK0022, solarbio) were used to detect motor neurons, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. An Olympus IX73 inverted microscope with DP80 camera was to attain all images. Motor neurons (MN) were identified and counted following strict size and morphological criteria: First, it should with diameters larger than 20 \u03bcm. Second, it should be with polygonal shape and prominent nucleoli. Only MNswith these characteristics werecounted (Dutta et al. 2018; Mancuso et al. 2011). For each animal, three fields of view per section were imaged and at least three sections were analyzed. All images were then analyzed by personnel who were blind to the genotype and treatment of the mice.

The clinical progression of mice was evaluated weekly by measuring forelimb deformity, rotarod performance and body weight.Forelimb atrophy in the Wobbler group was graded as follows: (1) atrophy of forelimbs, (2) flexion of digits, (3) flexion of wrist, and (4) flexion of forelimb over the chest [34]. Visual inspection of changes was carried out weekly from the beginning until the end of treatment, and expressed as the deformity ratio of forelimbs between days of assessment over the first evaluation day. The rotarod test was employed to evaluate motor performance (Rotarod apparatus Model 755 Stoelting, IL, USA). Mice were placed on an accelerating rod (1 to 40 rpm) over a period of 180 s in order to determine the ability of the mouse to maintain on a rod that turns at accelerating speeds. Animals were pretrained every day during 1 week before treatment and were evaluated during eight weeks after treatment. We recorded the rate of acceleration (rpm) at which animals fell down and the length of time they could remain rotating. Each animal was evaluated three times and the average performance was used for animal comparisons. Rotarod performance was shown as the latency of time to fall (seconds). Thirteen to fifteen mice in each experimental group were evaluated weekly at the level of paw atrophy and rotarod performance.",

Sixty days after insertion of the implants, mice were euthanized by decapitation in the time range 10.00 AM\u201312.00 PM to avoid circadian effects. As anesthetics and stress can influence steroid levels, mice were handled gently to minimize stress and were quickly euthanized without anesthesia. Cervical spinal cords were dissected and frozen over dry ice and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until analysis. Samples from 2 different mice were randomly pooled to obtain sufficient amount of tissue, i.e., at least 40 to 50 mg, to detect with high precision the targeted steroids with a suitable signal-to-noise ratio. Levels of testosterone and its derivatives in cervical spinal cord were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS) [35]. Data (mean\u00b1 SEM) were expressed as ng/g. Trunk blood of control (n = 14), control + testosterone (n = 4), Wobbler (n = 7), and Wobbler + testosterone (n = 4) mice was collected, and serum levels of LH and FSH were measured by RIA with kits from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (Bethesda, MD, USA) and Dr A. F. Parlow (National Hormone and Pituitary Program, Torrance, CA, USA). As previously described, the results were expressed in terms of RP3 rat LH and FSH standards because these systems recognize mouse proteins [29, 36]. Assay sensitivities: 0.10 ng mL\u22121 for LH and 1.2 ng mL\u22121 for FSH. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 7.2% and 11.4% for LH and 8.0% and 13.2% for FSH, respectively [36].",

        "text": "Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence. At the end of the treatment period (60 days), 22 mice (control, n = 8;Wobbler, n = 8; Wobbler + testosterone, n = 6) were prepared for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses. Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of xylazine (Bayer, Argentina) (6 mg/kg) and ketamine (Holliday-Scott, Argentina) (75 mg/kg) and perfused intracardially with 0.9% NaCl followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The cervical spinal cord segments C2\u2013C6 were dissected after laminectomy, postfixed for 2.5 h in 4% PFA and then immersed in 20% sucrose overnight for cryoprotection or in 70% ethanol for paraffin inclusion. Pituitary, adrenal gland, testis, and seminal vesicles were also collected to evaluate the effect of testosterone on endocrine glands and target tissues. Tissue sections obtained with the microtome (5 \u03bcm) or cryostat (30 \u03bcm) for immunohistochemistry, were first washed in 0.01 M phosphate buffer containing 0.14 M NaCl (PBS) and then immersed in H2O20.3% in methanol to block endogenous peroxidase. Following preincubation in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C, sections were incubated overnight with a primary antibody labeling motoneurons (choline acetyltransferase-ChAT) or astroglial cells (quiescent and reactive astrocytes: glial fibrillary acidic protein- GFAP) under conditions specified in Table 1. Sections were then washed, incubated with the secondary biotinylated antibody and processed according to the instructions of the ABC kit (Vector Labs, CA, USA). The peroxidase activity was revealed using diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (DAB, 0.25 mg/ml, SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) in 0.01% H2O2 for 7 min in the dark. After a final rinse in PBS, sections were dehydrated in ethanol and xylene, and covered with mounting media (Permount). For immunofluorescence, cryoprotected tissues were embedded in Tissue-Tek (OCT Compound, Miles Inc., USA) frozen over dry ice and sectioned (30 \u03bcm) in a cryostat at \u2212 20 \u00b0C. Sections were washed in PBS, and subjected to antigen retrieval in a microwave during 10 min at 120 \u00b0C in 10 mM citrate buffer. After incubation in 3% BSA in PBS for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C, tissues were incubated with antibodies labeling 3- nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and microglia [Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1(IBA1)] prepared in 3% BSA, 1% Triton X100 in PBS (Table 1). After further washes, sections were incubated with the 2nd antibody conjugated to Alexa 555 or Alexa488 (Table 1). Finally, sections were washed with PBS, dried at room temperature, and mounted with Fluoromont-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, Alabama, USA). Nonspecific labeling was identified in sections without the first antibody.Immunofluorescence was examined with an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope equipped with a disk-spinning unit (DSU, Olympus Corporation, Japan). Digital images were acquired using Cell Sens Dimensions software from Olympus and photographed with a Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4.0 monochromatic camera (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K, Japan). Quantitative analysis of immunoreactive cells was carried out every 6 sections along the cervical spinal cord (from C2 to C6 level) [32, 37, 38]. Digital images of DAB-stained sections were captured under the same light intensity and exposure time. Immunofluorescent images were analyzed using the Image J Software (NIH, MD, USA), while DAB immunoreaction was analyzed using Optimas Software (Bioscan Optimas 6.02, USA) [32, 37, 38]. We adjusted the exposure time to acquire fluorescent images below the saturation level for the highest immunofluorescence signal and this condition was kept throughout all samples. Measurements of 3-NT immunofluorescence intensity level in neuronal bodies of the ventral spinal cord were performed with maximum intensity using FiJi-ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD)[39]. The number of ChAT, 3-NT, GFAP, or IBA1+ cells was quantified in the region of interest of the grey matter (ventral horn) and white matter (ventrolateral funiculus and corticospinal tract). Results were expressed as the number of immunoreactive cells per unit area. We also determined the microglia morphological phenotype according to Torres Platas et al. [40]. Ramified microglia showed small body and several highly ramified processes. Primed microglia showed an ellipsoid soma with fewer ramified processes. The reactive microglia contained a round soma with some ramifications, whereas amoeboid microglia lacked processes. Phenotype classification was performed using \u201cZ-stack\u201d analysis employing an EZ-C1 3.70 free-viewer. Identification of the ramified, primed, reactive, and amoeboid forms was carried out in at least 10 Z-stack images measuring 1-\u03bcm thick. Results were expressed as % cells in each category.We analyzed the presence of 3-NT by immunofluorescence microscopy.",

        "text": "Real Time PCR. For RNA extraction, 39 mice (control = 13, Wobbler = 12, Wobbler + testosterone = 14) were euthanized by decapitation, and cervical spinal cords were obtained under RNAsefree conditions and frozen over dry ice and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until used. Tissues were homogenized with a Politron homogenizer and RNA extracted with Trizol (Life Technologies- Invitrogen, CA, USA). Concentration and purity of RNA was determined by measuring the OD at 260 and 280 nm. After ethanol precipitation, samples were diluted with distilled water to a concentration of 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcL. Total RNA was treated with DNAse 1 (Promega), and cDNA was synthesized in the samples from 2 \u03bcg RNA by incubation with the enzyme reverse transcriptase M-MLV (Promega) during 60 min at 37 \u00b0C after treatment with an RNAse inhibitor. Cyclophilin b was used as the housekeeping gene in all the samples. CDNAs were amplified in a Step One Plus Real Time PCR Systems, employing 10 or 20-ng cDNA under optimized conditions consisting in 10 min at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles at 95 \u00b0C during 0.15 s and 60 \u00b0C during 1 min. The relative gene expression was calculated by the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394ctmethod [42], and results expressed as fold change compared to controls.

To induce EAE C57BL/6 mice between 6 to 8 weeks of age were actively immunized using a peptide consisting of amino acids 35\u201355 of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35\u201355, EVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK; synthesized and HPLC purified by R. Volkmer, Charite\u00b4, Berlin, Germany).

Control animals were immunized with an equivalent volume of CFA emulsion that did A b-Lactam Antibiotic in EAE not contain MOG35\u201355 peptide. Additionally, all mice were injected intraperitoneally with pertussis toxin (400 ng; List Biological Laboratories, Campell, CA, USA) at the time of immunization and 2 days later. Mice were evaluated on a daily basis for changes in body weight, overt signs of illness, and clinical signs of EAE by two blinded investigators using the following 10-point scoring system (Fig. 1, 5): 0, no neurological signs; 1, distal tail limpness; 2, full tail limpness; 3, beginning broad-based gait with mild ataxia; 4, severely broadbased gait and pronounced ataxia; 5, mild hind limb paraparesis; 6, severe hind limb paraparesis; 7, hind limb paraplegia; 8, tetraparesis; 9, tetraplegia, moribund; and 10, death attributable to EAE.

        "text": "Western blotting of whole mouse brain protein. Non-immunized WT C57BL/6 mice were treated with ceftriaxone (200 mg/kg/d i.p.) or an equal volume of saline, sacrificed after 5, 10 or 15 days of treatment and lysates from cortex, hippocampus, optic nerve and spinal cord were used for western blotting procedures. Brain tissue was washed with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Germany)) and solubilized by sonification on ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged and protein content in the clarified supernatant was measured using the Bradford reaction. Samples containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Protein transfer was visualized by Ponceau S staining and membranes were then blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% dry milk. The membranes were probed with rabbit anti-EAAT2 (1:50; Merck Chemicals, Darmstadt, Germany) directed against n-terminal amino acids 16\u2013 31 of the transporter to assure detection of both EAAT2a and \u2013b and rabbit anti b-actin (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) as protein loading control. The secondary antibody was HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:3000; Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). The antibody reaction was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (ECL, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) (Fig. 2A). Specificity of the EAAT2 antibody binding was assessed by 5 hours incubation of the undiluted antibody with the immunogenic synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 16\u201331 of rat EAAT2 (Merck Chemicals, Darmstadt, Germany) previous to western blotting (Fig. 2B).\n\nTo assess the regulation of EAAT2 protein expression levels in the CNS in response to ceftriaxone treatment, non-immunized C57BL/6 mice were injected daily with ceftriaxone (200 mg/ kg/d), sacrificed after 5, 10 or 15 days of treatment, and the EAAT2 protein content of several brain areas was assessed by western blot.",

        "text": "Radioactive glutamate uptake in rat primary mixed glia cell cultures. Uptake of radioactive L-glutamate was measured in the rat primary mixed glial cell culture after 5 days of incubation in standard-media containing various ceftriaxone concentrations (Fig. 3). Subsequent determination of uptake was performed using solutions composed of (in mM) 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4 supplemented with 60 mM L-glutamate and 6 nML-[3H]glutamate (Amersham, Freiburg, Germany) according to the known Km value of EAAT2 for glutamate [19] as well as ceftriaxone at the respective concentration. To determine the fraction of total glial uptake mediated by EAAT2, the EAAT2- specific uptake inhibitor dihydrokainate (1 mM; Sigma-Aldrich, Mu\u00a8nchen, Germany) was added. To determine the sodiumdependence of the uptake, sodium-free solutions were prepared by substituting sodium with N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG). L- [3H]glutamate uptake was terminated after 5 min of incubation by 3 times washing with glutamate-free solution, cells were suspended in 0.5% SDS and subjected to scintillation counting after lysis. Uptake of L-[3H]glutamate was linear for at least 10 min (data not shown) and pre-incubation with ceftriaxone did not change the average number of cells per well (data not shown).",

        "text": "Whole cell patch-clamp. Standard whole cell patch-clamp recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) amplifier. Borosilicate pipettes were pulled with resistances of 1.0\u2013 2.0 megohms. More than 80% of the series resistance was compensated by an analog procedure resulting in calculated voltage errors ,5 mV. Currents were filtered at 5 kHz and digitized with a sampling rate of 50 kHz using a Digidata (Axon Instruments) AD/DA converter. Transient transfection of tsA201 cells with pRCCMV hEAAT2 using the Ca3(PO4)2 technique was performed as previously described [51]. To identify cells with a high probability of expressing recombinant transporters, cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding the CD8 antigen, incubated 5 min before use with polystyrene microbeads precoated with anti-CD8 antibodies (Dynabeads M-450 CD 8, Dynal, Great Neck, NY, USA) and detected through a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope. The CD8/hEAAT2 cDNA ratio was adjusted to ensure that almost every cell with beads exhibited currents with characteristic properties (Fig. 4A). Cells were clamped to 0 mV for at least 2 s between 10 ms test sweeps to potentials between 2200 mV and 100 mV were applied. Current amplitudes were determined 2 ms after the c-peak. The composition of the standard solutions was as follows: extracellular (in mM) 140 NaCl, , 4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4; intracellular (in mM) 115 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Substrate-containing external solutions were made by adding 500 mM L-glutamate. Extracellular recording solutions contained either 1 mM or 0 mM ceftriaxone and previous to electrophysiological assessment, tsA201 cell transfected with hEAAT2 were incubated over-night in standard-medium containing either 1 mM or 0 mM ceftriaxone as indicated (Fig. 4B, C).",

        "text": "Behavioral and Electrophysiological Analyses. Hindlimb and Forelimb Grip Strength. Animal weighing and all behavioral data collection began 1 week prior to transplantation, and was conducted twice weekly until end-stage. Hind- and forelimb muscle grip strengths were separately determined using a \u2018\u2018Grip Strength Meter\u2019\u2019 (DFIS-2 Series Digital Force Gauge; Columbus Instruments, OH) [16]. Grip strength testing was performed by allowing the animals to grasp a thin bar attached to the force gauge. This was followed by pulling the animal away from the gauge until the hind- or forelimbs released the bar. This provides a value for the force of maximal grip strength. The force measurements were recorded in three separate trials, and the averages were used in analyses.",

In order to quantify double-labeling of HuNA with lineage-specific (pan-GFAP, Olig2, NeuN, Iba1) and proliferation (Ki67) markers, double-labeled sagittal sections containing the entire cervical enlargement, as well as additional rostral and caudal spinal cord tissue, were imaged at 206magnification using Zeiss AxioVision software. Images were analyzed in AxioVision at specific distances from the injection sites. For each animal (n= 6 mice), 6 different 206images were analyzed at each specific distance (3 in gray matter, 3 in white matter. In each image, every HuNA + cell with a matching DAPI + nucleus was assessed for co-expression of the lineage-specific marker, and these data were pooled from the 3 images to determine the value at each distance for each animal.",

The scoring criteria were based on the 0\u20134 rating system recommended by the ALS Therapy Development Institute (ALSTDI) [28]. The criteria used to assign each score were as follows: 0 score, the full extension of hind legs away from the lateral midline when the mouse is suspended by its tail, the mouse can hold this position for 2 s at a time when suspended two to three times; 1 score, the collapse or partial collapse of leg extension toward the lateral midline (weakness) or the trembling of hind legs during the tail suspension; 2 score, the toes curl under at least twice during a 12-in walk, or any part of foot is dragged along the cage bottom/table; 3 score, the rigid paralysis or the minimal joint movement, the foot is not being used for forwarding motion; 4 score, the mouse cannot right itself within 30 s from either side. Therefore, this study assessed the effects of ATRA treatment on the ALS disease progression based on changes in ALSTDI scores [24, 29, 30].",

The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000\u00d7g at 4 \u00b0C. The protein concentration in the supernatants was determined with the BCA Protein Assay kit (Solarbio, PC0020, Beijing, China). Protein samples (20\u2013 50 \u03bcg) were separated by the SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and transferred to the PVDF membranes (Millipore Corp. Bedford, MA, USA).

        "text": "Immunohistochemistry and Image Analysis. For the immunohistochemistry, all mice were anesthetized and perfused 4% paraformaldehyde in 1\u00d7 PBS (pH 7.5) at room temperature. The spinal cord was rapidly extracted and put into 4% paraformaldehyde buffer overnight, hatched in 20% sucrose-PBS buffer (pH 7.5), and embedded using the OCT compound. Then, 12 \u03bcm sectionswere successively cut in a Leica cryostat (Wetzlar, Germany) and pasted on the Superfrost Plus slides. In the processes of spinal immunohistochemical stain, sections were permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100 and blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin (Boster, China) after rehydrating in 1\u00d7 PBS (pH 7.4), and incubating using the following primary antibodies: anti- NGFR, (1:200, R&D Biotech), NeuN, (1:250 Abcam), and GFAP (1:750 Abcam) at 4 \u00b0C overnight, and subsequently washed 5 times for each 5 min using 0.2% Tween 20 in 1\u00d7 PBS. The secondary antibody used fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) donkey anti-goat (1:250, Abcam), and tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC) donkey anti-rabbit (1:200, Abcam) for 2 h at room temperature. Next, the sections were washed 5 times for each 5 min using 0.2% Tween 20 in 1\u00d7 PBS buffer and incubated with DAPI (Boster, China) for 10 min. Finally, the sections were mounted with the antifade medium and observed on a Nikon E800 fluorescent microscope with a spot digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI, USA). For the quantitative analysis, NeuN- and GFAP-positive cells were counted manually at least 100 neurons per slice per animal following an established protocol [33]. The relative fluorescence intensity of NGFR used optical density value calculated by the Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA), and the detailed protocols were the same with the description of our previous studies [23, 24, 32].",

The hind-paw extension reflex test was used to define the onset of disease and the loaded-grid test as a measure for the progression of disease.23,24 The extension of the hind limbs when mice are suspended in the air by the tails is diminished early during the course of their life span, long before motor neuron loss takes place.22 This test was performed five days a week by one investigator (GJG), who was blinded for experimental groups. The loaded grid test is a test of muscle strength, as mice have to grip a small loaded grid with a total weight of 40 g, and are then lifted by their tail. The length of time mice are able to hold on to the grid, with a maximum of 30 sec, is measured.24 The loaded grid test was performed twice a week by the same investigator (JdLvW). An impossibility to hold on to the loaded grid for more than 1 sec was considered a measure for progressed muscular weakness. For ethical reasons, the clinical endpoint was defined as the moment mice were no longer able to right\nthemselves within 2 seconds when laid on their back. After reaching the clinical endpoint, mice were sacrificed.",

The influence of CGP 3466B on the number of motor neurons in the spinal cord was evaluated in two mice from each group, at the age of 110 days, when onset of disease as defined by the hind-paw extension reflex test is usually present, but overt paralysis is not. The mice were anaesthetised with Nembutal (300mgkgx1) injected intra-peritoneally. After opening of the thorax, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with heparin (20 IE/ml) was infused intra-cardially for 1min. Subsequently, mice were fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde. The spinal cord was dissected and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA in 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) at 4\u2021C. The spinal cord was cryo-protected with sucrose solution overnight at 4\u2021C. The lumbar segment of the spinal cord was fixed on a cork paper impregnated with M-1 embedding matrix (Sakura, Bayer). This was frozen in isopentane, which was cooled by liquid nitrogen to a temperature of x160\u2021C. For identification of motor neurons, every tenth transverse spinal cord section (10 mm) was incubated overnight with a polyclonal choline acetyl transferase (ChAT)-antibody (goat-anti-ChAT (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA); diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 0.2% BSA and 0.1% NaN3 (PBS-BSA-Azide)). Sections were subsequently rinsed with 0.1M PBS, incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (rabbit-anti-goat-antibody (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA)(diluted 1:220 in PBS-BSA-Azide) for 1 h, and finally incubated with a horseradish- peroxidase conjugated Avidin-Biotinylated Complex (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) for 1 h. Motor neurons were visualised using DAB-Co-Ni 25 and the sections were counter-stained with Nuclear Fast Red.",

This instrument measures the peak amount of force an animal applies in grasping specially designed pull-bar forelimb and hindlimb assemblies. Briefly, mice were held by the scruff of their back and drawn along in a straight line along the sensor assemblies to allow the mice to grasp the forelimb pull-bar assembly, recording the force applied by the forelimbs of the mouse in Newtons. In a continued sweep, the mouse was drawn along until the hindlimbs grasped and released the hindlimb assembly, again recording the force applied by the hindlimbs of the mouse. Forelimb and hindlimb strength were measured by the same investigator (SJD) three times and averaged during each weekly assessment. It is critically vital that a single investigator performs the grip strength measurements due to inter-rater differences in tensile strength.",

The novel object recognition tests were conducted in an openfield arena (30\u00d730\u00d730 cm) constructed with polyvinyl chloride, plywood and acrylic, as previously described (61). The task included training and retention over two consecutive days. On day 1 of the training session, the animals explored two identical objects (black plastic cubes, 5\u00d75\u00d75 cm) for 5 min. On day 2 of recognition session, one of the objects was replaced by a gray plastic square pyramidwith a newshape and color (5\u00d75\u00d77 cm), and the animals were again acclimated to the area for 5 min. The field was decontaminated with 10% ethanol and a dry cloth between the tests. Exploratory behavior was defined as the mice sniffing or touching the objects with their nose and/or forepaws at a distance of less than 2 cm. Sitting or circling around the objects was not considered to be exploratory behavior. The exploratory behavior was manually evaluated using a video camera by an observer blinded to the test conditions. Total exploration time was defined as the total amount of time spent near the two objects. Cognitive function was measured using a recognition index, which was the exploration time involving either of the two objects (training session) or the novel object (retention session) compared with the total exploration time. This calculation was performed at the end of the experiment.",
